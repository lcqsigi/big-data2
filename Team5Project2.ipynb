            "compre este celular hace    dias  y al principio crei que no lo podia activar  yo vivo en colombia  y el operador con que tengo mi cuenta celular de voz y de datos es comcel  despues de sincronizar el celular  funciono bien para la parte de voz  reconocio perfectamente la sim card  el problema fue el plan de datos  yo antes no tenia blackberry  asi que tenia que hacer el cambio de plan de datos de celular normal a bb  cuando fui a comcel dijeron que han tenido muchos problemas con esta referencia      storm  y que es el unico que no esta homologado para ellos al parecer los otros operadores movistar tigo si   asi que no me podian hacer el cambio de plan de datos  la solucion fue llevar otro bb para que quedara registrado en el sistema y luego cambiar la sim a mi celular para que funcionara  hasta ahora de esa forma funciona bien el plan de datos a veces se cae el pin pero regularmente funciona bien  lo malo fue hacer todo ese proceso que me tomo mucho tiempo sin poder usar mi plan  pero si lo segui pagando  otro problema que tiene el celular es que la pila dura muy poco  usandolo regularmente me dura un dia o un poco menos  otra cosa es que no reconoce los contactos de la sim del celular  esto no se si es problema de la configuracion y debo hacerle algo  o simplemtene no los reconoce  entonces yo marco por el nombre y dice que la marcacion esta errada  toca digitar el numero siempre  pienso que para el precio el celular funciona  al menos  pero tiene los problemas que mencione anteriormmente  hay que pensar en los beneficios que uno prefiere  algo de calidad y mas costoso  o algo que simplemente funcione o aveces no pero a un precio moderado  espero les sirva mis comentarios  y si alguien sabe como debo configurar mi telefono para que no tenga que marcar el numero de mis contactos en vez de buscarlo en mi telefono le agradeceria la ayuda bought this phone    days ago  and at first i thought that i could not activate it  i live in colombia  and the operator that i have my mobile voice and data is comcel  after synchronizing the cell  it worked well for the voice  recognized perfectly the sim card  the problem was the data plan  i did not have blackberry before  so i had to make the switch from regular data plan to bb plan  when i went to comcel they said that they have had many problems with this reference      storm  and is the only one not approved for them apparently the other operators  movistar  tigo works with that reference   so i could not make the change of plan data  the solution was take another bb to stay logged into the system and then change the sim to my phone to function   until now this way works well  the pin of the data plan sometimes falls but regularly works well  the thing was that the whole process took a long time while i could not use my plan  but still paying   another problem with the phone is that the battery have a very short duration  using it regularly this works a day or a little less  another thing is that it does not recognizes the sim contacts in the telephone  i don't know if it is a configuration problem and i must do something  or just does not recognize them   then i mark the name and says that tagging is wrong  always i must dialing the number  i think for the price the phone works at least  but has the problems that i mentioned before  you have to think of the benefits that you would prefer  something of quality and more expensive  or something that just works and sometimes not  but at a moderate price  i hope that my review help you to take the best choice  and if somebody know how i should configurate my cellphone to this recognize my contact list instead to have to dial the number everytime i will appreciate your help \n",

            "over the last several months i have been taking many photos and receiving many urgent messages so i decided that i would purchase a  smart phone   i had attempted to set up an account with  t mobile  but they kept on asking for information about me that i already had provided  i grew frustrated and canceled my order it was at this point that i decided to purchase this phone  i would have been better off if i had provided  t mobile  with the same information for the next           years when i opened the package i discovered that the bottom portion of the phone which functions as a sort of case for the battery compartment was damaged  the phone doesn't or can't scroll up or down  and the printing in the instructional manual is so microscopic that you need superman's eyesight just to have a chance to read it  furthermore unlike some other technology related products there is no online version of the manual that you can turn to so that you can read it easier the battery is lousy  it provides  power  for only about   minutes  a major problem also is that after you open the package you discover that you were given the wrong information as to what memory card to purchase the information that is given by the provider to  amazon  is that it takes a micro sd card  it does not  instead it requires a sim card it goes without saying that it would have been most helpful if i had known this in advance as i would never have ordered a piece of crap such as this i believe that a refund is in order and that is being quite mild about it \n",

            "i bought this phone because all my friends had one and i want to chat on bbm with them for free apps the apps that are available for this phone are not that great  i've seen way better for the iphone and for android  most of the good apps are not free  only a few good ones are free  such as kaplan's gre word app and dictionary com's dictionary and thesaurus operating system it comes with     version of the operating system but you can upgrade it for free to version     memory it doesn't have a lot of memory so you will definitely need a memory card if you want to store more than   songs and some pictures on it  it comes with   mb of storage space for music and that is woefully inadequate for today's phone user  there is much more space for apps though so you won't have to worry about that looks the phone is not very big but it is not small  please buy a phone case and a screen protector so you can retain your phone's value and look for a long time  the keys are small but because they are kinda slanted you should not have a problem typing warning  this phone takes forever and a day to boot up so please don't turn off your phone unless you absolutely have to bbm and bis you will have to dig into pocket when you get this phone if you intend to do anything with it because all im apps  e mail and such have to go through your blackberry e mail address and you will have to pay for blackberry internet service in order to get the e mail address  depending on the carrier you use  you might have to spend about    extra per month for the internet service  i think that's because you have to access rim's servers and you need to pay for that camera the camera takes pretty good pictures  i've seen better but this is pretty good  one thing that i've never seen on another phone  so far  is the video light  the video light is rather unique and is brighter  i have tested it  than the flashlight on a nokia phone battery the battery life on this phone absolutely sucks it cannot last for more than    hours or so  i have to charge my battery every single day and that is not cool calls you can make calls from a lot of places on this phone  the calls are not that loud but it's ok  speakerphone is also available  you can makes notes about what happens on each call and i like that a lot  you can also do pretty much anything on the phone while you are on a call  also  if you want to make a call and you are  for example  playing a game you can just jump out of the game  make your call and jump right back into the game without losing your progress and that's awesome all in all  this is not the best phone ever htc has that but this is a very good phone to have especially when it comes to keeping social \n",

            "this is an awesome phone  even in the day of touch screen enabled  octa core processor driven monster phablets  i have owned android and windows phones as well as older blackberries  the reason i went back to a blackberry was because of its enhanced security in the age of malware that has penetrated android and ios devices  battery life is much better on this devices as well  in addition  the phone does not encounter crashes and random restarts like the other aforementioned devices that most people own  sure there are not as many apps  but isn't that what tablets and pcs are for having a physical keyboard is a plus too  since it allows more accurate typing \n",

            "my first blackberry was a      back in      on verizon  while even at the time it wasn't the 'in' thing it was definitely a solid phone that did what it was made for really well  this one is no exception and it does it all even better caution  phone carrier rant ahead anyone with half a brain knows that the large phone companies are completely screwing us over with the price of using a phone  you know how much it costs them for you to send a text zero  you know how much it costs them for you to send      texts zero  i promise you it doesn't require    a month for them to keep your  gb or less of data running either  i bought this phone partially because i wanted to switch to straight talk but i still had a couple months left on my verizon contract that they rape you for if you cancel early  with this unlocked phone i was able to stay on verizon's cdma network until my contract was up then easily switch it over to straight talk which is basically the at t gsm network by putting in the sim card and just switching the system on the phone to gsm  for anyone interested  straight talk is a pay as you go plan that's    a month and it's unlimited everything  no contracts  etc  it worked without a hitch  end rant the phone itself i think is very underrated and under priced for such a high quality product  it's basically the same build quality as the iphone  s or iphone    it's plenty fast and does what you like without any lag  for anyone having issues setting up email or accessing the web on the data connection  you have to activate the phone and wait for your carrier to basically tell the phone that it's okay for it to connect with them  this can take up to    hours after activating your phone  if it doesn't  call your carrier and they should be able to get you up and running  my only problem with the hardware of this phone is the battery  compared to other basic phones and other blackberries it doesn't last as long due to the faster processor  i suggest buying a second battery just in case  they're only about   here on amazon  overall you're getting a lot of phone that can keep up with a lot of the other smartphones out there for a much lower price  i'm not disappointed in any way \n",

            "i had a bold      and was obsessed with it  then i got a q   and hated it  had so many problems with it  i had all but given up on blackberry but i was so attracted to the physical keyboard  which makes texting  emailing and web browsing a breeze  the build quality of this phone is high end and nicely done  the keyboard is the best keyboard on the market  the screen is great and easy to read in bright sunshine  i love the browser and the camera as well  its just the perfect phone and i am so thrilled with it \n",

            "you should seriously consider the blackberry classic if you want a device that is designed for efficient communication pros   real keyboard  real vs  virtual keyboards are a personal preference  i have always preferred a physical keyboard  and in particular the way blackberry designs the layout and functionality of their keyboards  the classic maintains that level of quality and efficiency of use  moreover  the ability to assign functionality shortcuts to the keyboard gives you a lot of room to customize your device to fit your work style   the hub  all of your messages and alerts including social media are kept in a centralized interface that is always available with a swipe  the thing i hated about ios which i haven't used in a long time and android from which i just switched was the piecemeal approach those platforms take towards integrated communication  i primarily communicate via email  text and blackberry messenger  having all of those messages in a quickly accessible  consolidated list has increased my productivity measurably   legit os  blackberry os    is clean and functional  plus  you can run android apps directly  which gives you the best of both blackberry and android  it is now incredibly easy to load the google play store on your bb and install android apps  you don't even have to root the phone or jailbreak it  i run firefox  google maps  waze  sirius xm  and various banking and travel apps through the android runtime  i don't play games on my phone  so i can't testify as to how those types of apps run  but i have had very few performance issues with running basic productivity apps   blackberry blend  very nice and easy to use file transfer app  works wonderfully on mac os x  far superior to android file sharing apps for os x   battery life  this thing is a workhorse  i run bluetooth and wifi on it and it lasts me throughout the day cons   memory    gb internal memory gets eaten up quickly  especially when you add a bunch of android apps  sd cards are cheap though   screen size compatibility w android apps  the classic screen is more square ish  so apps that are designed for full length screens may have some issues  these are fixed  usually  by easily changing the resolution on the fly to mimic widescreen phones similar to letterbox functionality on tvs  all in all  if you're an android person  you can have the security of a blackberry  the superior physical keyboard of a blackberry  and the business communication focused design and functionality of a blackberry  and still be able to run android apps \n",
            "i owned the q   before this and this is a great upgrade  battery life is better  os      is amazing  the camera is sharper and more vibrant  voice command and voice to text works well  and having a physical call hang up button plus a trackpad only enhance the experience i had with the q    i did notice at times the phone can be sluggish  mainly when i'm trying to swipe i also do miss having a replaceable battery   overall  though  i highly recommend this phone i should mention that if you are using t mobile like i am  the wi fi calling will not work with the latest os  disappointing  but not a deal breaker for me  \n",
            "i am an old blackberry fan  bought it mainly for the keyboard and former user friendly software of the curve and bold series  very good hardware quality including battery but camera is just ok  i wonder why have the programmers made it so complicated they should improve on the former software  not change it so much  main criticisms the name you search for a call or sms stays in that window until you delete it  irritating  it takes   steps to create a new contact from a phone number  it used to be one  you can't make the photos smaller in kbytes to share them via mail  wapp or twitter  i do hope software updates improve some complicated steps and make this otherwise good and unique phone more user friendly  wish the best to the blackberry team  keep going \n",

            "my co workers tell me constantly that blackberry does not hold a position in the upper echalon of cell phone society  but i am ok with that  my blackberry curve purchased from my cellular provider   was dropped from the top of a ten foot ladder close to forty times onto a concrete floor no case and  no  not intentionally    and it still kept going  not even a cracked screen  so when my husband who works in construction was ready to make the move to a smartphone  blackberry seemed the logical choice  lightning speed  an impressive list of apps  and cool video games didn't make the short list  but durability was key  his blackberry curve      also purchased from our cellular provider   served him well for two years  when it finally gave up the ghost mine is still plugging away   he opted for a replacement rather than learning a new phone the only problem was that our provider no longer had a contract with blackberry we had to purchase an unlocked phone elsewhere  so i puchased this one the phrase in the header  no warranty  should have been a red flag  but my experience with blackberry over more than   years dissuaded me  after only three months  this phone developed issues  it locked up to the point that either the trackpad would work but not the keys or vice versa  we attempted powering down  hard reboot  utilizing blackberry desktop manager software  and a reset to factory default settings  no joy  off to our cellular provider we went and my husband is now learning a new phone some may think that three stars for a phone that only worked three months is a bit generous  but i am taking into consideration blackberry's track record  my extreme loyalty to blackberry  and the fact that my husband is very tough on phones before his move to a smartphone  he was going through about two flip phones each year  this curve      appears to have fixed itself as now everything seems to be working again it is  however  off network so i cannot confirm this  i will keep it charged and hang on to it just in case mine goes  wonky  then i will know for sure one thing i would like to mention while trying to breathe life back into this phone by pulling the back cover  battery  sim  and sd card  then replacing them  i did notice that it was a bit  squeaky  and  clicky  meaning it didn't fit together as solid as my phone from my cellular provider there was more  play  in how it all fit together mine fit tightly with no clicks or squeaks my bottom line i am a loyal fan of blackberry  but the phrase  no warranty  should probably play into your decision if you are considering this item for purchase \n",

            "my co workers tell me constantly that blackberry does not hold a position in the upper echalon of cell phone society  but i am ok with that  my blackberry curve purchased from my cellular provider   was dropped from the top of a ten foot ladder close to forty times onto a concrete floor no case and  no  not intentionally    and it still kept going  not even a cracked screen  so when my husband who works in construction was ready to make the move to a smartphone  blackberry seemed the logical choice  lightning speed  an impressive list of apps  and cool video games didn't make the short list  but durability was key  his blackberry curve      also purchased from our cellular provider   served him well for two years  when it finally gave up the ghost mine is still plugging away   he opted for a replacement rather than learning a new phone the only problem was that our provider no longer had a contract with blackberry we had to purchase an unlocked phone elsewhere  so i puchased this one the phrase in the header  no warranty  should have been a red flag  but my experience with blackberry over more than   years dissuaded me  after only three months  this phone developed issues  it locked up to the point that either the trackpad would work but not the keys or vice versa  we attempted powering down  hard reboot  utilizing blackberry desktop manager software  and a reset to factory default settings  no joy  off to our cellular provider we went and my husband is now learning a new phone some may think that three stars for a phone that only worked three months is a bit generous  but i am taking into consideration blackberry's track record  my extreme loyalty to blackberry  and the fact that my husband is very tough on phones before his move to a smartphone  he was going through about two flip phones each year  this curve      appears to have fixed itself as now everything seems to be working again it is  however  off network so i cannot confirm this  i will keep it charged and hang on to it just in case mine goes  wonky  then i will know for sure one thing i would like to mention while trying to breathe life back into this phone by pulling the back cover  battery  sim  and sd card  then replacing them  i did notice that it was a bit  squeaky  and  clicky  meaning it didn't fit together as solid as my phone from my cellular provider there was more  play  in how it all fit together mine fit tightly with no clicks or squeaks my bottom line i am a loyal fan of blackberry  but the phrase  no warranty  should probably play into your decision if you are considering this item for purchase \n",

            "i previously owed an android phone and windows phone  here are my thoughts on a few features this blackberry leap offers built quality plastic body doesn't give you a premium feeling as those found in iphone or samsung's premium phones  but it never feels cheap  it is a solid phone on your hand camera simply  it sucks  initially  i thought it's the stock camera app didn't excel  i purchased another high rated camera app from the store but frankly the photo quality doesn't improve significantly  it's just not sharp enough  the worst thing is that the camera fails to focus quite often security this is where this phone excels  blackberry surely can keep its reputation with os    for most apps  you can control what functions to be allowed or denied by the apps  such as camera  mic  files  emails etc  this is not true for android or windows phones which only let you know what the apps will have access  but never allow you to individually pick which ones to give access right  furthermore  if you lose your phone and anyone attempts to enter an incorrect password ten times to unlock your phone  the phone will start wiping its data  peace of mind assured battery non removable  but really good battery life  for me  i can recharge it every two days  i use the phone primarily for checking emails  whatsapp messages  surfing the web storage it has    gb  but it also supports up to     gb micro sd card  that should be enough for most people for storing documents or multi media files apps very limited  windows phones have even more apps than blackberry store  not to mention iphone or android  however  major apps such as whatsapp  facebook  twitter are available  i personally do not need to use many apps in my phone or play games using my phone  if you need to be entertained by tons of games  then you will be deeply disappointed call quality really good  this phone has two mics so it can pick up your voice nicely  its volume is very loud at its max level so it's less likely that you have an issue to hear the other side even you use your phone in a noisy environment blackberry hub it's a single point of accessing all your messages  such as emails  text message  notifications from apps etc  so you need not open each app to read or compose messages  however  one thing that annoys me is that you need to actually open the messages or mark them as read by tapping on the envelope icon to get rid of the notification  otherwise it will always show as new messages arrived i hope by listing the pros and cons would help someone who don't have a chance of using this phone  especially those who are curious about blackberry os   \n",

            "i previously owed an android phone and windows phone  here are my thoughts on a few features this blackberry leap offers built quality plastic body doesn't give you a premium feeling as those found in iphone or samsung's premium phones  but it never feels cheap  it is a solid phone on your hand camera simply  it sucks  initially  i thought it's the stock camera app didn't excel  i purchased another high rated camera app from the store but frankly the photo quality doesn't improve significantly  it's just not sharp enough  the worst thing is that the camera fails to focus quite often security this is where this phone excels  blackberry surely can keep its reputation with os    for most apps  you can control what functions to be allowed or denied by the apps  such as camera  mic  files  emails etc  this is not true for android or windows phones which only let you know what the apps will have access  but never allow you to individually pick which ones to give access right  furthermore  if you lose your phone and anyone attempts to enter an incorrect password ten times to unlock your phone  the phone will start wiping its data  peace of mind assured battery non removable  but really good battery life  for me  i can recharge it every two days  i use the phone primarily for checking emails  whatsapp messages  surfing the web storage it has    gb  but it also supports up to     gb micro sd card  that should be enough for most people for storing documents or multi media files apps very limited  windows phones have even more apps than blackberry store  not to mention iphone or android  however  major apps such as whatsapp  facebook  twitter are available  i personally do not need to use many apps in my phone or play games using my phone  if you need to be entertained by tons of games  then you will be deeply disappointed call quality really good  this phone has two mics so it can pick up your voice nicely  its volume is very loud at its max level so it's less likely that you have an issue to hear the other side even you use your phone in a noisy environment blackberry hub it's a single point of accessing all your messages  such as emails  text message  notifications from apps etc  so you need not open each app to read or compose messages  however  one thing that annoys me is that you need to actually open the messages or mark them as read by tapping on the envelope icon to get rid of the notification  otherwise it will always show as new messages arrived i hope by listing the pros and cons would help someone who don't have a chance of using this phone  especially those who are curious about blackberry os   \n",

            "this device really is well constructed and when in the hand you can feel the excellent build quality  the key issue with blackberry is the lack of apps in the blackberry app store  but you can easily side step that via the cobalt plug ins which allow you to install the google play store and most google apps  most of the other reviews haven spoken about the keyboard etc  so i won't rehash those but i must say i expected a bit more from the battery given its size  i currently get       hrs with mixed use  i also notice some warming in the top right corner of the phone once you have restarted the device or have a power hungry app running but overall i'm impressed with the phone \n",

            "a true blackberry device  well the last of its kind for blackberry will stop with its hardware manufacturing and will just continue with its software  i love the design and quality of the passport  the only drawback is the app selection from blackberry world even if they put amazon app store on the device it's not close enough to google store or app store  there is a workaround thanks to cobalt    this guy is genius now if blackberry will support his effort and all the die hard blackberry fans out there  just imagine a fully stable and working google play store and all its app for blackberry os \n",

            "title note i ordered my device  and like a few other reviewers here have found out it was the uk version  the seller made no mention of this  the listing page said nothing of this  and the seller feedback i provided about this was struck through by amazon since it was  fulfilled by amazon   it arrived with a uk powerplug by blackberry  and a cheap plastic non ul certified adapter that the seller provided it wouldn't stay in the wall  as the prongs were the same size instead of industry standard  and after a minute or two was hot to the touch  make sure to ask the seller what version the device is  as i didn't have a uk power adapter and their included solution was frankly unsafe the phone itself  had i gotten it when it first released  would have been an instant love affair the size takes getting used to  but having a phone this wide makes sense for two handed use and really fits well if you have larger hands  the software is smooth  no crashes have occurred and the update process is smooth  i've got a few android apps running  and the only thing that happens is the music from apps like spotify or groove might automatically pause a simply tap on the play key brings it right back each time the os is effectively dead  but the navigation via the touch sensitive keyboard is smart and really makes you wish for the days of palm blackberry really had something here  even though it obviously didn't appeal to enough people to keep their vision afloat  the main thing i've been surprised with is that it's a really good phone calls and messaging are really where this phone shine  and speaker calls or using a headset make the experience impressive the typing experience took me two days before i got the hang of it  soon the gestures and shortcuts became second nature and speed was back to normal  if you're coming from the q   or classic and the like the onscreen numbers are the biggest change  but acclimating isn't hard  the hub is always a favorite feature  whenever i go back to blackberry having everything in one place just makes it so much nicer compared to having multiple apps you have to check  and works great with multiple email accounts and work battery life is excellent  and i routinely get through the day with    of the battery left and ready to go  the device is sturdy  you don't really feel the need for a case here  and the textured backing is much improved over the normal passports version there are quirks  the camera takes a second to focus and makes it easier to lose fast moving targets it's also not the best in low light  so keep that in mind  video watching on a square screen is obviously going to be hard and less enjoyable  so if you're a youtube netflix junkie this probably isn't a good choice  the browser also takes issue with certain sites security certificates gfycat is the main one that comes to mind since it's no longer getting updates  and whitelisting isn't always something it lets you do picking a passport se in      is weird  but if you're a light app user or not invested into google's ecosystem you'll find a unique experience that brings back the days when phones were for business and getting work done was paramount  it's an os that's no longer being developed  by a company that once was an industry juggernaut  but their care and expertise show \n",

            "i'm in love with this phone  as an avid blackberry fan  going from curve      to bold      to q   this is by far a work of art  it takes a while getting used to the android os and i do miss some of the simple blackberry apps such as the gallery or music player which i find overly complicated on android  as well as the hub integration is not quite as smooth as on q   considering hardware  it's a sturdy phone  sliding keyboard works smoothly and typing is super easy  the screen with the rounded edges feels great to the touch and works without problems  image quality is superb in terms of camera or sound quality i'm sure there's better options but works alright for me altogether  well done \n",
            "at first this was a great phone  but after   days this phone started to over heat and black out  you can hear the phone sounds but the screen is completely blacked out plus the phone gets very hot very fast  i was able to return the phone with no problem  and get a full refund  i will order a new one someday but i will wait untill they get the bugs fix on that model phone before ordering it again \n",
            "beautiful  nothing wrong with the phone  it is an unlocked att phone but any sim will work  just came back from europe and i used two prepaid sims from local vendors no issues  it does not come with a weather app  you need to get one and if you dont want adds  you need to pay for it  even though it is unlocked  it still comes with all the att garbage apps and you cant remove them unless you root it  it has all the advantage of the google apps  but the os does not have the beauty and the usability that the blackberry os has  it lacks a file manager  and the hub does not have all the functionality of the blackberry os  which is the reason for the four stars  when you consider the price though  a great deal \n",

            "first off  i bought the phone as a replacement of my sony z  dual i've always been an android user so decided to stay with them  current flagship phones are too expensive and i don't want to pay for it so looking into mid tier phones or older flagship phones  i got an alert these were sold from amazon not some  rd party seller for     so i jumped on it  i figured if it didn't work out i could return for credit and buy the various other phones out there unlocked pros got marshmallow update fairly quickly through autoloader real easy  everyone should be able to do it large battery to get me through the day big screen  curved sides help with holding the phone mostly stock android with a few tweaks that make life just a bit easier scrolling with the keyboard is literally the biggest thing for me on screen keyboard has the best word prediction solution i've ever seencons a little flimsy  when i type on the onscreen keyboard there is a noticeable sound and bend or flex wipe the front face of the phone might cause the slider to move the back kind of feels weird and is plastic despite this being a flagship phonemiddle keyboard  so it's great to have a physical keyboard but it's also a bit small  i don't have large hands or fingers and i found it difficult to type using the keyboard  also to hit the top row it's hard due to the slider portion just above it wish it was usb c but that hasn't been commonplace until recently  mute button  i guess it's good overall a great phone for the price  the initial unlocked price was just too much \n",

            "what an awesome phone my first smartphone was a blackberry curve  that was years ago  then came the iphone  which i got because everybody else had one  yeah  it was cool  i've used various iphones for so long  i thought blackberry had gone out of business  by chance i stumbled across the q    for a couple of hundred bucks i took a chance  and i'm glad i did  i got it home  opened it up and right away noticed the quality build  this thing just felt solid felt good in my hand  i popped my att sim card in and within a couple seconds  the q   sprang to life there's nothing about this phone i don't like  mind you  i don't surf the 'net on my phone nor do i play games on it  so the smaller screen is irrelevant  for texting  the q   can't be beat  with its real  gen u ine keyboard  typos are nearly a thing of the past  the hub is nice  too  all my notifications email  twitter  facebook  texts  etc  in one handy place but what i really love is that you can expand the storage capabilities via a micro media card  so there's virtually no end to the number of mp  pictures video files you can have on your q    and with the micro hdmi port  you can watch mkv's or mp 's on your tv how cool is that the operating system runs smooth and fast  the accessories are reasonably priced  including a new battery   bucks   so  all i can say is   goodbye iphone and itunes and hello freedom  \n",
            "if you are a blackberry fan  you will like the q   \n",
            "my driving reason behind getting this particular phone was that i'm die hard qwerty blackberry seems to be the only manufacturer keepin' the dream alive first thing i loved about this baby was the size look of the phone  classic bb design yet still contemporary enough that you won't hear any stupid remarks from people about how  you need to get a new phone   lightweight perfect size if you don't want to feel like you're walking around with a flat screen in your pocket for the most part the phone delivers on the qwerty level  well made keyboard  perfect size texture spacing etc  unfortunately  there's no trackball as with prev  bb models or any  arrow  keys thus all cursor control is touchscreen which is annoying before you get the hang of it getting service with at t was no problem  wi fi bluetooth multi media all seem to function fine  slight peeve for me is limited profile options for volume control  you basically have only  normal silent vibrate or off  now  this is what's really troubling no android  unless i'm overlooking something this phone has no android capacity or capability contrary to another purchaser's comment i repeat no android it's      i need my android  it's really that simple if you're like me need your qwerty but don't have or want to spend     on some of the higher end bb's with a keyboard  then this may be your phone  if you want android though  well \n",
            "update after   months of use the keyboard has failed  the alt and s keys will no longer register  blackberry support refuses any warranty service as this phone was  not purchased from amazon  and is not covered by a typical manufacturer   year warranty  i expect much more than   months of use from a     phone breed offers only their return policy which is of no help  and didn't offer any assistance for pursuing a warranty repair straight through blackberry needless to say i am very disappointed  if you plan to use this phone for any reasonable length of time be prepared to repair it yourself or be screwed out of your money \n",

            "my driving reason behind getting this particular phone was that i'm die hard qwerty blackberry seems to be the only manufacturer keepin' the dream alive first thing i loved about this baby was the size look of the phone  classic bb design yet still contemporary enough that you won't hear any stupid remarks from people about how  you need to get a new phone   lightweight perfect size if you don't want to feel like you're walking around with a flat screen in your pocket for the most part the phone delivers on the qwerty level  well made keyboard  perfect size texture spacing etc  unfortunately  there's no trackball as with prev  bb models or any  arrow  keys thus all cursor control is touchscreen which is annoying before you get the hang of it getting service with at t was no problem  wi fi bluetooth multi media all seem to function fine  slight peeve for me is limited profile options for volume control  you basically have only  normal silent vibrate or off  now  this is what's really troubling no android  unless i'm overlooking something this phone has no android capacity or capability contrary to another purchaser's comment i repeat no android it's      i need my android  it's really that simple if you're like me need your qwerty but don't have or want to spend     on some of the higher end bb's with a keyboard  then this may be your phone  if you want android though  well \n",
            "update after   months of use the keyboard has failed  the alt and s keys will no longer register  blackberry support refuses any warranty service as this phone was  not purchased from amazon  and is not covered by a typical manufacturer   year warranty  i expect much more than   months of use from a     phone breed offers only their return policy which is of no help  and didn't offer any assistance for pursuing a warranty repair straight through blackberry needless to say i am very disappointed  if you plan to use this phone for any reasonable length of time be prepared to repair it yourself or be screwed out of your money \n",
            "i purchased this phone from breed  i was a bit nervous as  rd party seller could be hit or miss  a factory sealed  brand new phone arrived very quickly i was still nervous because once i opened the box  all instructions etc  were in spanish  and it had both us and foreign ac plug  but  the unit was sqn       and unlocked as promised  worked both with t mobile and at t sim card  from the logo on the box  the phone looked like it was sold in costa rica  nevertheless  sqn       is for north american bandwidths so no worries  i am very happy with this purchase i was android user for about   years but all the new phone on the market look the same  there's nothing i wanted to buy  then i heard new blackberry os    can run amazon appstore app  i didn't want to jump on to     passport  so i decided to give brackberry a try with an older and now very affordable model  the keyboard is just awesome i love love love it  i can add other language for input up to     this phone is truly global  no bloatware  all i needed to add was the appstore  kindle  and amazon music  amazon appstore didn't come pre loaded and it wasn't in blackberry world  it took me a while to find out how to dl it  just go to http www amazon com getappstore from the browser  make sure to allow non blackberry app to install in the setting  the screen may be small in today's standard but the display is crisp i have no problem with it whatsoever  i'm still learning the blackberry gestures but i am so glad i got this phone  if you are tired of generic android i highly recommend blackberry \n",

            "i switched over to blackberry from iphone  s  there are less apps  but you can sideload apps like uber or whatever if you really care  i will not go back to android  and the newer iphones are not for me  there is some functionality i miss  but i think the overall functionality of the phone as a communication device is superb \n",

            "first off  i'm a lifelong apple fan as far as computers go  but i'm certainly a convert from iphone used the iphone       and the ipad mini and replaced my iphone with this when sprint wanted to charge me     to buy a new iphone  s  as far as this product versus other q  's  perhaps you're wondering about buying this versus the much more expensive black q   without the arabic keyboard  they're identical except that this also comes with european african power plugs  plus a flimsy but functional north american one plus  who doesn't have a few extras lying around i sure do   so  that's convenient  and hopefully you won't be fazed by the documentation in uk english and arabic  learn about how to set up your favourite smartphone    next up  maybe you're wondering about buying this versus the blackberry classic they're also basically the same phone  same amount of ram  same processor speed  same internal memory  the blackberry classic has the old school buttons  which is fine  but not worth the extra     for me it's important to note that when you buy the q    you're not buying an iphone   you're buying a blackberry  all of the badmouthing of the blackberry brand ignores the fact that this is not a device that is designed for watching netflix or playing glorious games although   most people i know who own iphones don't watch netflix on their iphones  and most of them write e mails on their laptops  case in point pros most apps work great  whether kindle android or native bb  i've downloaded groupon  instagram  various photo apps  airbnb  a banking app  shazam  ny times  wikipedia  amazon store  a couple of twitter clients  and it comes with evernote and a decent note taking app that can do voice memos as well  i'm having some frustrations with facebook native   but it works ok  size is convenient to hold in your hand  and the classic bb keyboard is great  ability to take notes during calls  for when a customer service representative gives you that super important phone number  durable  feels more durable than any iphone i've owned and comes with a free rubber hardshell case  great battery life  my iphone will often die before   am  and this powers through the day even with heavy use  charging doesn't go so fast  but i guess you can't win 'em all  call clarity is amazing and the speakerphone is super loud  swipe up equivalent of the home button becomes extremely comfortable fairly quickly  i was skeptical at first  having gotten used to the old school blackberry buttonry and even the iphone home button  but it works great and hasn't failed me yet  fast and not fazed by a multitude of apps and data  expandable  cheap memory  comes with   gb built in and you can get   gb on top of that for    on amazon  easy to customize notification settings and it's set up intuitively  screen is great  when you close out of an app  you automatically see all of the open apps and therefore don't tie up valuable ram running stuff you're not using this was a peril on the iphone   the hub works alright  i was prepared to hate it  but it's pretty convenient  and it's easy to navigate around to adjust settings  add new accounts  delete accounts  etc  it's sort of like a glorified home screen  transferring contacts was a breeze  and the os actually automatically added a ton of stuff that i was glad i had notified me  for example  of a meeting i had coming up before i had even transferred anything over i guess from an e mail account   nfc stuff is easy to use  the facebook app is imperfect but lets you conveniently use fb messenger inside the application instead of having to use a different application  included hdmi port cons special multi touch gestures aren't quite as advanced as the iphone  which i find myself lamenting probably a few times a week on random stuff  included earbuds in headset are absoutely horrendous  haven't figured out how to set up a good podcast app  i haven't been able to get absolutely every app to work on this phone  but there are only two that i am going to have to  sideload   those being uber and yelp  sideload  meandering in command prompt slash developer nonsense slash upload download file conversion nonsense   i think that's a product of blackberry having relied on the amazon kindle fire appstore instead of google play  as the fates would have it  the google play website doesn't really work very well on the phone's browser  so you're sort of sunk until you figure out how to sideload android apps which isn't quite a piece of cake but also isn't the worst  it's much easier to download apps on the blackberry than it was on my old iphone because i don't have to type in my password every time i download something  so it's easy to try out new apps and there are plenty  but really  how many calendar apps do you need notification led  while fully customizable  is pretty weak and only illuminates on the front side as opposed to the linear led on the tour curve  which sort of sliced through the top of the device so you could see it in a holster or when it was lying flat  i really liked the tour's function of the lock button an the mute button at the top they were hard plastic and easy to access  this has no such thing  just a lock button at the top  which is fine  because you can easily swipe up to unlock and customize your lock settings not to mention add hotkeys  which the iphone lacks in any comparable way   special function button is inconveniently placed between the volume rocker buttons  making it clumsy and easy to press accidentally or hard to press intentionally  on my tour it was on the opposite side of the phone  making it great for pushing with your thumb while your index and middle fingers could access the volume buttons  voice control kind of stinks  but then again  siri ain't perfect neither  i find that it works okay for voice dictation  but it's very hard to ask your device  for example  where you can get a good meal in grand rapids  it's technically good  but not very smart overall  i'm pretty satisfied  not entirely perfect as far as the not mainstream app situation is concerned  but that'll get better  and it's great to have a community of die hard bb fans who are always willing to help on forums like crackberry \n",

            "i will not compare with android or iphone since this product is clearly for the blackberry fan  with that said  there are some major flaws  some of the apps from blackberry world  supposedly designed for this phone  don't work or work only sometimes  the voice command is a joke it has very limited capabilities when it works i do a lot of international travel and it is disconcerting that in some countries the time does not update  creating all kinds of problems with the calendar  i miss the old versions where you could keep a  home  time while traveling another problem for international traveling is that the sleep mode has no exemptions  it is an all or nothing deal  it would be nice to block everything at night  but still allow your wife or kids to contact you in case of emergency  if you travel to complete opposite time zones  you know what i am talking about  people in the states don't know you are sleeping and you receive calls all night long  you go in sleep mode and nobody can contact you  that is a deal breaker for me \n",

            "i purchased this phone april  th      for about      it is now march   th       and the phone is so messed up i have to go tomorrow to tmobile and buy a new phone  this phone made it    months and now it has to be completely replaced a few months after i bought this phone  i noticed that the camera would not take pictures with the flash  the light would come on and stay on  but not take a picture  i figured  fine i can live with not being being able to use the flash  it is a pain  but i have a regular camera that i can use if need be  i also noticed  and i don't know if the phone is normally like this or if this irritation goes along with the camera malfunctioning in general  but it takes a long time for the camera to focus so i actually miss a lot of shots and it really pissed me off about three months ago  i noticed that sometimes i would try to switch between my mail accounts on the phone and it would not register that i was trying to get to a different mail account or it would not register that i was trying to switch from looking at the folder with emails to the folder with text messages  so  for example  i would be looking at gmail and then want to switch to looking at my text messages  i would go back a screen and click on text messages but the gmail screen would pop back up and no matter how many times i selected text messages or even my other email account folder  the gmail folder would open up also  around   month ago  the phone would just shut off and i would have to restart it  i figured since these phone are like computers  it probably needed rebooting  but the frequency with which it would just shut off started to indicate that there was a problem with the phone  also  sometimes i would push the button to get the screen to come on or swipe the screen to get the screen to come on and it would not come on the phone would just stay black so i couldn't use the touch screen features  or sometimes i would be on the phone and i would try to get the screen to come on so i could hit end  but the screen would not illuminate so i couldn't hang up the call myself these past couple weeks  the phone just started shutting off and i would have a significant charge left on the phone of about      the phone would shut off and when i went to turn on the phone the empty battery icon would come on  today  it shut down at about    and the empty battery icon came on  i was trying to avoid buying a new phone because i invested so much in this one and it isn't even a year old so i was going to walk around with a charger and make sure that i kept a charge of over      but since the phone just cut out today at around    it is not safe for me to rely on this phone anymore the problem with this purchase is i have no recourse      down the drain for a phone that didn't even last a year and has to be replaced at    months  this is the first and last time i buy a phone from amazon rather than through phone company  previous   star review written shortly after i purchased it before anything went wrongi was on the phone with someone for     hours and when i checked the phone it still had some ridiculously high amount of battery life left  it was either    or      either way  that is impressive i love that the keys are spaced farther apart so typing is much easier than on the bb curve  i am still getting used to it  but overall i like the phone  the combo of touch and keyboard is great  some of the stuff is not intuitive  i had a hell of a time trying to figure out how to change the main ringtone  i could figure out how to give each individual contact a special ringtone if i wanted to  but i could not figure out how to change the general ringtone  the answer was not in the online manual and  to be honest  i have no idea how i finally got the answer  but i actually had to spend time on the internet looking around for the info  the sound quality is great  i can dance to the ringtones it is bigger and slipperier than the bb curve  but i bought the rubber casing thing for it that has grips on the side  i do miss the smaller size  but i'll get used to it  i also liked this over the q   because the keys on this are actually separated whereas the q   has them connected \n",
            "i think it would have been a great phone for my purposes  the phone had some issues  believe it was defective and had to send it back  it kept dropping calls  some of the calls would go directly into voice mail  i have decided i do not want to be a blackberry owner after this \n",
            "excellent size  it's smaller compare to its bb brothers  but feels comfortable to grab and handle  and it's very light  file administrator works great  very easy access  hub alows you to personalize it according to your needs and has a great location  you can follow the apps you put there without open them which allows you to save up some data  voice commander it's better from last versions  very accurate  sound it's excellent quality except for the speaker  just ok player works great  no need to download another  camera is good  nothing special  but better from older versions screen sensibility it's awesome  os it's very fast  switching from app to app it's quite easy  youtube connection performance it's very poor as in other older bb versions it's a beautiful  useful  and easy to manage  buy it without a doubt \n",
            "just got it yesterday and am in love  tons of features  got the white one  st for my brother few weeks ago he's back home in the caribbean and he loves it   it works pretty good back home we get to chat and stay in touch with each other  which i love \n",

            "the keyboard is simply not as good  i don't know why anyone would pay an extra     for a marginally better keyboard  but i missed my also stolen  ugh q   terribly whenever i attempted to compose anything more profound than  hey baby picking up wine home in      more frustratingly to me specifically  it did not support t mobile's  g lte service and was thus rendered rather worthless as a mobile hotspot  had it supported my lte service  and had it not been stolen  i might have gotten over the keyboard thing and ultimately declared it the smartphone bargain of a generation  because i generally think blackberry overall suffers from even worse luck than i do and i had five phones stolen last year w r t its eternally crappy pr  the q   is an exquisite phone  and the blackberry    operating system is as intuitive and robust as they come  if you can get  g lte service on the q  and don't have some sort of corporate overlord picking up the extra     for a q    by all means buy this phone \n",

            "i never had any experience with blackberry  i usually try to find most bang for buck products  so was attracted to this phone as a entry into something other than android based phones  as i have been less than happy about the constant upgrading and obsoleting of the google dominated platform  i am old school  and older age as well   and get frustrated having upgrades constantly forced on me  and having things that work fine for me no longer being supported my gripes are the same about microsoft monopolies are just no good  back on track the phone was ok in build quality  basic  not cheap  but definitely  entry level  somewhat plastic e feeling and lighter weight the os being new to me was a bit overwhelming  but seems loaded with functionality  perhaps too much just for casual use anyway everything all tolled  i decided to return the phone  it just did not seem to fit me now a twist  and a recommendation if you are considering this phone  stop and seriously consider spending the extra and get a q   instead under normal circumstances i would consider the q   out of my price range while it is in reality still reasonably priced  i'm just a cheapskate whenever i can be  but i think here is a classic case of you get what you pay for i stumbled into a great deal on a q   so figured  what the hey  the q   is a completely higher lever  coach to fist class upgrade style   it feels solid  hefty  and is rather elegant  the rounded bottom  as opposed to squarish bottom on the q   makes a big difference to me in holdability  and the keypad seems more comfortable  especially when hitting alt along with   or    something i found almost impossible on the q   now i have not used it a lot yet  but it seems to have a nicer display  really nice camera  and the call quality seems great both with and without speaker phone the removable battery is a big plus  q  is non removable   and give away deals are available on genuine bb batteries bundled with compact little usb chargers anyway do yourself a very big favor  and if considering the q   wait and get the q    you will be very  very glad you did  the difference is like like night and day\n",

            "the performance and features on this phone are great  such as wifi direct  allshare  lots of supported video formats including mkv   office  social apps and bbm has also improved  however the only negative i have is that the touchscreen does not feel as smooth as the z    when trying to close some applications or when trying to see the application list  the phone is sometimes non responsive  although the qwerty keyboard is convenient  it obviously reduces the screen size therefore it feels like too much is packed into an area  overall it's a good phone for the price and i'm happy with my purchase \n",

            "alright  i received this handset on friday  i was almost on the verge of returning it  but have not done so yet  first of all  i have had iphone  g and galaxy s  in the past  this is my first blackberry  so took a bit of time getting used to  let me explain the pros and cons and then you will get it  i'll go with the cons first cons    this phone has a plastic feel to it and many may not like the bright red color does not look as professional    the biggest problem i had was with the internal memory of just  gb  the moment you get the phone  you will be tempted to install a few apps and before you know more than  gb will be taken up by the system memory  now why do you need memory  you need it to upgrade to      of the os unless you do it  you will be stuck with the blackberry world and will miss out on the amazon android app store  upgrading the os will allow you to install android apps  otherwise you won't be able to enjoy the phone as much as there are only a limited number of apps on the blackberry world  i actually had to factory reset the phone once to reclaim the space i needed  so  tip the moment you get the device  use your computer to upgrade the os  before you even think of setting up any apps    the facebook app has a serious flaw on blackberry devices  browse the internet a lil bit  you will understand what i mean  many facebook posts will simply not load on the bb app  however you can open the browser and access facebook com fine from there    the contacts from linkedin and facebook take a lot of time to sync  i wish it was faster    you have to be careful during the os upgrade  if you get your phone disconnected from the power supply or usb during an upgrade  it may turn into a qwerty paperweight  a red qwerty paperweight rather    they are advertising    mp  but its officially a  mp camera  the only time i actually got a photo bigger than   mp was when i took it in panorama mode  yeah       x      pixels which looked pretty decent on the computer screen  in any case   mp is not bad  how big do we print on an average but questions remains if    mp should be advertised not as many shooting modes as i experienced with s  probably i should not even compare    the videos i had on my media card did not play not even after i installed few video apps from amazon store   but youtube worked fine pros    this phone has a beautiful red color i know what you are thinking   albeit a plastic feel  so if you are a fan of red  you will like it    the phone is pretty easy to use once you get accustomed to it  the keys feel real nice on the fingers  no more auto correct and no more screen freezing while typing that oh so important message    once you have the android app store  you have both bb as well as android apps you can have best of both worlds    the bb hub is nice provides a one stop view of all updates liked it    the fm feature seems to be nice  have not used it though  not yet    the speaker volume is okay    setting it up after the os upgrade is easy  albeit time taking overall  i feel this is a decent phone if you are planning to use it for business and basic entertainment  this is not designed for world class video and audio experience or for gaming  but this is not that expensive either  so in terms of value for money i give it four stars ps  i may come back and edit this review if i have a change in my user experience  let me know if you found this feedback helpful  adios           edited to add i have an international trip coming up and vying for a dual sim phone  but that's not why i started to edit this review    i wish the camera on this phone had better sensors  while  i still maintain that   mp should never have been advertised  when it is a  mp camera  i expected at least pictures worth  mp  but this phone disappoints in the camera department  i will still keep my rating unchanged  as otherwise this phone has held up very well    i use it for emails and whatsapp very frequently    for facebook  i use the browser  the bb app is awful    i have started using the fm feature  you need to have your headphones on  else it won't work  but pretty good reception    just found out the kindle app does not work on q   it freezes will come back later  if i find something else worth mentioning  i might have to reduce one star soon  adios \n",

            "i bought this as a replacement to the mid tier android smartphone  firstly  it cannot do as many things as my old phone could  it can come close  and you can change quite a few things on the blackberry q   simply because it can't get the same apps sideloading is useful  but far from ideal   it's square screen  and because of blackberry os  the biggest thing for me buying this phone was the keyboard  as this or the q   are the only recently released smartphones with a keypad firmly attached to them  this one was cheaper  so i bought it  and really enjoyed using it for the       days i had it  i'll get to it later  i got the red one  and boy was it red bright cherry red  similar to the beats shade of red  for reference  all plastic  i got quite a few compliments on the phone  however everyone will ask you why you have a blackberry  there are haters out there  one thing that bugs me is that my emails are one of the notifications on the lockscreen  i don't like to check my email very often  so i feel guilty when i see a bunch of emails every time i see the lockscreen mine shut off randomly maybe     times during the period i used it  the last time it happened it would not turn back on  it would only get halfway into the resart cycle and die again  regardless of the buttons i pressed or things that i plugged it into  it wouldn't turn on  completely dead  i looked it up and apparently there is a rare i found maybe a dozen other people that it happened to chance the power supply is f ed and it will send your device into an infinite reboot cycle  i sent it back and got a refund after using it less that   days  right after i got used to it and set it up the way i wanted it  i payed        usd for it new  free shipping  i got a refurbished q   for         plus shipping  which is what i'm typing this out on  think curve vs  bold  the q  is a bit beefier internally and has a better camera  removable battery  amoled screen versus q 's lcd  it feels classier  and the matte charcoal looks much more professional than cherry red  i like the keyboard much better on the q   than the q   i don't like how the keys are separated and angled as individual buttons  i enjoy using the q  's uniform rectangular keys all right next to each other  i'm sure a lot of people might like the q 's better though because on the q   each button has a slight bump  or dune on one side of it  it's great for touch typing  which i found a bit harder on the q   but i could see how to some people this would be a grievance  disregarding aesthetics and build quality  the phones play exactly the same  same operating system  and same screen resolution  it took me    minutes to tap this out on the keyboard  including thinking about what i wanted to say  that's probably not far from how long it'd take if i sat at a computer  i'm a bit high rn  ymmv \n",

            "very sturdy phone  camera is amazing  speakers are also good  display is truly bright and colourful  the shortcuts available when you swipe down the screen  is now enough  emails fail to download when i dont connect to wifi or data for few hours but only download that arrive after i reconnect  i was using letv s before  the charging was faster  overall good phone\n",
            "skip this one  very buggy still after a year of patching  device keeps giving pop ups like it knows best  keeps asking to connect to their bbm message app after repeatedly saying no i don't want your junk  i had to install it just to shut it up  pop up asking to connect to wifi even when shut off  many of these issues that just makes the whole experience frustrating  all of this is just indicative of the attitude blackberry has of them assuming they know what's best for u and thinking they are too smart to be ignored  horrible attention to program design  i mean how can u screw up an android os well blackberry managed to somehow  if this was my first android device used  i'd think google was to blame but thank god i had a samsung galaxy to know android os is actually real easy to use and is not like an annoying salesman that won't go away i'm not gonna waste anymore time with this device including writing this review  returned  refunded\n",

            "this is my second blackberry  my previous phone was a bold     which i had for a while  i love the bold series and contemplated upgrading to the       but then the      came out and i contemplated that as well  after reading the reviews on it however concerning the battery life  i decided against it  i decided to go for the      instead  the specs are basically the same  gb   mp camera  touch screen keyboard etc  so for me  there was really no big difference except the slide  another motivation as well was the ability to use both the touchscreen and the keyboard  i am not a huge fan of full touchscreen phones and devices in general and so this fits exactly what i was looking for i have had it for a little under two months now and i am loving it  the os  is obviously quite different from the os  that my old bold was running but it is easy to use and i figured out how to do things very quickly  the camera takes clear pictures and also has the flash option  i do not have freezing issues or anything of that sort my battery generally lasts about   days  i generally use it for bbming  emailing  surfing  listening to music off and on and of course making receiving calls  i cannot speak for different types of usage such as videos  games etc  for me that's good enough  i have a friend with the      and by the end of the day they have to charge their phone and as i pointed out that was a major issue for me in choosing my only issue if it really is one is the keyboard  it took me a while to get accustomed to it  this may be of course because i was used to the bold's keyboard which was much sturdier  initially  i was afraid that this one would break i know it sounds silly but i have gotten over that now  ok long and short  am glad i bought this phone and would recommend it \n",

            "i was so excited to be part of the new 'touch' technology until i used it  this particular model does truly eat battery time like it hasn't been fed in years  it didn't help that i received the phone w a battery that expires in        my husband bought the same phone and his battery's expiration was        which explains why my phone kept shutting down and had difficulty re booting  i'm thinking of investing in a backup charger with a second battery for those days when i'm very busy on this phone  i don't make a lot of calls  it more like my 'second' brain i'm disabled and i need to keep more info reminders  alarms  memos  etc  than your average user  so blackberry is really the only true cell phone that can handle my needs at first i thought it was the phone that was dying  then i switched batteries with my husband's cell phone and my phone worked and his stopped that's when i looked at the  expiration date  on the battery  only to discover the big 'expiration time' discrepancy purchased from the same seller   so  be sure to check the date on your battery before you start switching phones  my husband had to go buy a new battery    just so i could be kept informed on critical information  i'll leave a comment on the seller's site about this issue  blackberry is truly a great cell phone manufacturer and i've owned several models for the last    years  having a desktop app that sync's with outlook is fantastic and the back up capability is the major reason for getting a blackberry   especially if you have a lot of info and need to set multiple alarms  events  reminders  memos  tasks  etc  no other cell phone manufacturer provides this kind of backup sync capability   nor do they allow for multiple alarms  etc  unless you want to pay     and up  i originally gave blackberry a    star rating  not just because of the items mentioned above but more importantly because i thought blackberry was dragging their feet in supporting their full features in the  pre paid  cellular market  all of my previous blackberry cell phones had been through one of the top wireless carriers and blackberry supports all it's features if you have a  post paid  account since we hardly used the wireless carriers' lowest package terms  we decided to save    and go with the same wireless provider's pre paid department  blackberry doesn't want to support  pre paid  customers  in fact  they won't support your cell phone unless you are a  post paid  wireless customer if you need support  expect to pay hundreds of dollars and even then   blackberry refuses to allow their best features to work as seamlessly as they do in the  post paid  arena  i'm a very loyal blackberry customer and i am hoping that blackberry will step up and be the professional company they have been in the past well  i figured out why all of this phone's functions features won't work and i owe a huge apology to blackberry  it's at t that's blocking this phone from being able to use all the features yes  at t if you want this phone to work     then you have to get it thru at t in a  post paid  environment  however  we bought this unlocked phone and activated it through at t's go phone  pre paid  environment and after all this time of at t telling me it was blackberry's fault  come to find out   at t is making a choice not to offer all features of blackberry cell phones in their 'pre paid' accounts not only will they not support all features  but at t lied to me for weeks saying it was blackberry's fault  i've been able to talk to blackberry suppoort extensively only to discover they offer all features at t has refused to contact me to discuss this issue i've escalated to  management    only to get their big corporate  run around  at t apparently doesn't really want to support smartphones  i've now wasted   weeks and i have a fantastic phone that is only capable of half of it's features because at t won't support blackberry smartphones i guess i'll just have to keep harassing at t until this  step up  and be the company they say they are update it's been a few days now and i now seem to have a more serious problem with the phone  it's set to automatically turn off at night and turn on before i awaken  however  this past week  i've been awake before the phone turns on and i've noticed that a few times  it goes through the 're boot' process before turning on this is not normal   it doesn't happen to my husband's torch       i orginally asked amazon to take the phone back  then changed my mind as the battery was defective  now  it seems the defective battery wasn't the only thing  defective   i'm in the midst of contacting amazon to see how to work out a return for a defective phone after    days  wish me luck bottom line i still like the torch      and will get a new one   one way or another i don't think i'll buy from same buyer though gmds wireless  \n",

            "i love the device  but i hated the seller  it's advertised as  factory unlocked   which  according to the seller  means  international   which  according to the seller  is equivalent to having features specific to united arab emirates  what that means is that ramadan will be on your calendar for   weeks in the summer  and there's nothing you can do to get rid of it  no other holidays are pre loaded into the calendar just that one muslim one  also  the charger i got was not for u s  outlets  and they sent a crappy black adapter with it  after going back and forth to no avail with the seller  and to little effect with amazon  i was directed to contact samsung for a user manual and for instructions to fix the calendar problem  haven't had time to mess with that yet  so i can't say if they'll be able to solve the problem  amazon sent me a u s  charger that matched the phone  other than that  i love the device  the big screen and s pen appeal to my middle aged eyes and somewhat old fashioned sensibilities  i like to write with pens   and it's really convenient to be able to jot things down and easily look them up or add to contacts later  etc  i'm far from an expert with smart phones this is my first one so i'll let others give you more technical run down on the phone  i'm very happy with the device \n",

            "okay  so the samsung galaxy note ii is obviously a great phone  and as i feel that reviews of this nature should focus more on the seller  i won't discuss how amazing this phone is  in and of itself  this phone is roughly     from at t  verizon  and amazon out of contract  the seller listing the product here is selling it for     less than anyone else and it's not used or refurbished  that is pretty spectacular  however  the battery that came with this phone is next to useless  it has no brand name marked on it and just says made in china  the life of the battery is terrible  i literally have to leave my phone plugged into the wall at all times  if i unplug it  the battery drains waaaay too quickly  my friend has this phone and his battery is not even close to as bad as mine  he bought his phone from verizon and it came with a battery that  while it looks similar in marking and color to mine  it says samsung across it  mine does not  his charger is also completely different  it's very likely that my charger is a fake too  although the piece that plugs into the outlet says samsung on it  it is not the stock charger that comes with the phone  the phone  battery  and charger came in a plain at t box that was not sealed  although it was shrinkwrapped  part of the box had been torn and patched with scotch tape  it came with the appropriate manual  fortunately  despite all of this  the phone itself is     legitimate and works perfectly  i will be forced to purchase a real battery for    or so and i will probably invest in a new charger at a later time  but this doesn't really bother me a lot  it irks me  slightly  that the seller felt the need to sell the phone with a s ty battery  but honestly  a battery and the actual samsung note ii box is not worth     extra dollars to me  if you need to buy this phone out of contract  then i would recommend purchasing it from this seller even though their choice of sending it with a fake battery is questionable  you'll still come out ahead purchasing this phone here and a new battery from somewhere else  i'm still relatively happy with my purchase  perhaps the seller should notify that this device ships with a third party battery instead of the oem samsung battery  but it's not a huge deal  if you want this phone new  get it here unless you want to pay     for a nice box and a battery  if you're okay with a used phone  then i recommend you go to swappa and look there  i don't like buying used electronics like this  however \n",
            "phone arrived as scheduled apparently undamaged  the box was a plain box labeled  at t  but not a new retail at t box  there was no  absolutely no  paperwork in the box just the phone  the battery  the wall charger  a usb cable and a set of samsung earbuds  the phone is a wonderful piece of electronics and the android os is easy to learn and use  i had to get a new sim  my old one was a full size and the note   uses a mini  the phone was instantly recognized by the at t system and picked up both a cell and data signal  the problem that i am having is with the usb connection  it is apparently defective  i can charge the battery  but only consistently if the phone is off  i have only been able to connect with my computer once  and that was a struggle  i have contacted samsung and they have assured me that the phone is under warranty should i need to get it repaired but that requires sending the phone in and having to pay to ship it there and being without it for who knows how long  as this is a  new  phone and an expensive phone one would expect that it would not need to be repaired upon arrival  i have not contacted the seller yet as i am still trying to see if the problem is software or hardware related pros beautiful screenfast processorresponsive osactually good battery life when i can get it charged cons at t crapware that is unremovable this on top of the os and samsung's software left a little over    gig out of the base    gig usable the usb connection problem that i am havingi would still recommend this phone to anyone that needs the screen size and does not mind the fact that it is a big phone update        the problem with the usb port was resolved by resetting the phone to factory default had to download the manual from samsung for directions   the problem did let me find out   things   the seller was quick to offer an exchange if necessary  good communication response and helpful and   the phone is covered by a samsung   year warranty  you do have to register the phone for warranty support \n",
            "everyone has left opinions on this phone  i ordered this phone which was listed similarly a small note from the seller indicated that it was an i   m  that is the designation for a canadian phone  they are completely unbranded the nice thing is that it indeed works on at t's lte frequencies  the only thing that you'll need to do is set the apn up yourself just inserting the sim sets up at t's old apn settings you'll need to change them to get lte speeds other than that  you get to enjoy a phone with none of the at t bloatware  and no restrictions in the software it's fantastic mark\n",

            "i was a bit wary  based on some reviews  about buying this phone  now  i am happy to say  it was a good decision before i spout about how much i love this phone  a few things need to be mentioned   this phone comes new unless you buy it from a seller other than the one above   this phone needs to be unlocked with a code that is provided by the seller and is on a sticker on the side of the phone box  it is a very easy process i took a pic but scribbled out the code in paper artist before uploading  so it is a bit artsy didn't feel like downloading a photo editing app for some reason  it didn't come with one    if you are using straight talk  you won't need to unlock it   i am writing this review in my own handwriting and it is converting it to text pic added for emphasis  note you can take a screenshot and write on it hold down the button on the stylus and touch pen to screen for a couple seconds   but you have to download an app to scribble on photos  i guess   downloading the manual and taking time to read through all the features is highly recommended  there are tons that most people never use   most people will not need all the features this phone has to offer  it is a phone that works  and by work i mean multi task and simplify all your tasks for business and or school that being said  i am a student of graphic and web design and i have a few projects for businesses i am working on  i have been wanting a tablet that i can draw  sketch ideas  and take notes with  but haven't found one reasonably priced i have a pretty small budget that could accomplish what i needed in other news  i wanted a new phone badly  my iphone   was worthless for what i wanted needed for school and work  i killed two birds with one stone by getting this phone i have nothing but praise for the s pen  amazingly accurate and looks like my own handwriting  which is something i have only seen in a microsoft surface pro  must be that wacom technology  the stylus is superior even to my wacom bamboo stylus i have already sketched out some ideas for a new website and the possibilities for school and work efficiency are endless with this thing  my calendars were synced  emails  google drive  etc  makes it easier than checking all that stuff from my laptop i won't bother with specs  those have been covered in other reviews battery life the more you have going on  the more battery you use  sorry overall  a money saving purchase for someone who wants a small tablet and a phone but can only afford one and doesn't want to carry both around win win \n",

            "i have been with net   for   months now and i switched from a bring your own phone sim card to this samsung  my unlocked hp pre   messed up and i saw this for only      free prime shipping  it was a steal this phone is exactly what i needed  it has features many basic phones don't have nowadays  things like a dedicated camera button  a cover for the usb charging port to avoid dust getting in and a standard headset jack  the menu is very basic  nothing out of the ordinary  easy to read  as far as the network goes  i did some research and after activating this phone i am certain the networks got switched from t mobile to verizon wireless coverage  this phone runs on verizon's cdma  x network  which is also a big plus for me because i have better signal and i'm saving   with net   over verizon's unlimited for basic phones plan  very happy with my purchase  the only negative thing i would point out is the keyboard itself feels really cheap  it has good tactile feedback but you can definitely feel the cheapness of it  i don't really mind as long as i can text fast on it  which i think is achievable once i get used to the keyboard  if this phone messes up i can always get a second one  at only      who wouldn't \n",

            "i bought two of these from amazon  i am currently using one of them  this is a solid phone when it comes to net   pay as you go phones and i have had a number of net   phones over the years  i have seen some reviews on other prepaid phones and see the compliants about the browser speed  this is not an android phone  if it's speed you want  buy an android  if it's just a basic talk and text phone  then this is the type of phone to buy  this phone is a cdma phone  it doesn't have a sim card in it  i have read in an online forum that this phone actually uses the verizon towers so the signal is carried by them  i have had no signal problems thus far with this phone no matter where i have been in my area  though there are different factors that can come into play when it comes to cellphone signal strengths and weakness's  the keyboard on this phone is easy to navigate  i do wish they had made the keys just a tiny bit larger but it is not a deal breaker as i have adapted to it and it's not an issue for me  there are several other functions with this phone  one of my favorties is the tip calculator  i'm admittedly lousy at math  it's handy to have there is a memo pad  another handy tool to have to write a note to save  remember  a note not a book  it has a calendar as well as a calculator  it also has a camera  again  this is a prepaid phone camera  don't expect over the top pictures  but they afre not bad at all for this type of phone  the battery life on this phone is outstanding too  i highly reccomend this phone \n",
            "this phone works just fine for someone who just needs a phone  i got the     minute plan and i have loads of minutes to burn through  so i tried using the browser  it wasn't as slow as the other reviews led me to believe it would be  it worked ok  but it is a little clunky and difficult to navigate  i'll only use it in emergency situations  i haven't tried the     service yet  but i suspect that will be faster than using the internet  the sound and the ringer are both good  the keyboard works well for me  but the buttons are too small for my husband to use  the battery life is excellent  good phone for the money \n",
            "i love this phone  it's easy to use  the only thing i do not like about it is it can easily go into the browser and burn away minutes if you aren't very very careful  but that's all i do not like about it \n",
            "i just wanted a basic phone  and this is it  don't expect internet access  facebook  etc  with this thing my friends mostly have phones costing     times this much per month i use the    month     minute plan   but their phones don't work in buildings  elevators  on the subway  etc   and mine does  it seems that net   rents working wireless access from expensive companies and then sells it to us i have purchased   of these phones  one was defective enough to return it  and a second one refuses to go into autolock mode  so i often find it browsing the net or writing its own text messages  to my knowledge it has never actually butt dialed anyone  i can lock it by just holding down the spacebar  but i often forget  it has never managed to use up my minutes  anyway a fourth net   phone also died before i started with these samsungs  so why do i give them   stars because they are practically giving these phones away  and the per month charge is reasonable by us standards the only reason i don't get yet another phone and dump my slightly defective one is that i'll have to type in about     digits to reprogram the new phone to take over my account as far as usability  the phone is great  the keyboard is fine  even though the keys are tiny and i can barely see them without glasses  it is miles better than my previous 'cheap' phones  which cost much more than these  the menus are well organized  and i use the phone as my daily alarm as well  i like the ringtones selection \n",
            "i just started using it but  i haven't noticed any problems  it seems to work well  no complaints as of yet  but i will let you know if there is \n",
            "first off you should know that this phone only charges     minutes per text received and send which is    of the regular net   phones and the main reason of my purchase  that being said important info you should know about this phone features    mega pixel camera  long battery life  quarty keyboardmy impressions keys are small but easy to type on  this phone does not support t  word and calling numbers is slightly more annoying since the keys are smaller then most are used to  i can't comment on the browser features since for some reason the phone is roaming in the wyoming area where i am located and it says data restriction    but from videos the browser is nothing special it is also worth mentioning that you can record your own ringtones and transfer audio and images back and forth from your computer via a data cable or blue tooth adapter  picture quality is better then my old    mp camera which was a scoop but it's still nothing amazing  i'm sure everyone has seen what most cell phone pictures are like  and this phone is no exception  but still it is nice to have the feature also you can lock the keypad by pressing and holding the spacebar down features aren't great but you can get around     minutes or about      text for    per month on this phone which is very cheap for those of us who don't talk much \n",

            "i ordered this phone as a replacement for another net    phone  which had been giving me trouble for ages  oh  what i would give to have that phone back my main complaint about this phone is that whoever designed it didn't give too much thought to usability ease of use  in the web design world  there is a general rule that a user should never have to click more than twice to get to any page on a site  the developer of this phone certainly did not have that rule in mind  i may be missing it  but i have not been able to find a speaker function on this phone  that means i can't drive while using it no bluetooth feature either and i can't use the speaker when i am typing and making business calls  the phone often has to be reset because the clock stops or the date is wrong the keyboard is also kind of weird  i thought you could use the shift button to switch from letters to numbers  but you can't  you have to click     sym  write out the number  and then go back to abc abc to write the rest of a message  this is a pain in the butt if you are trying to write several numbers in a message  as you have to keep switching between     sym and abc abc  all in all  this is not a good phone \n",

            "this thing was garbage  i would not recommend buying this unless you wanted to have a headache for an afternoon  after spending over an hour with verizon  and then an additional hour up at the verizon store  it was not able to be activated  the phone arrived covered in scratches  and in general was more of a hassle than anything  i'm not certain as to how i'm going to get that missing   hours back from my life  but  i'm sure i'll recoup that time from somewhere \n",
            "this is a nice little basic phone  it has a touch screen and a pull out keyboard for texting  i have only had it a couple of weeks but it is fine so far  it is small enough to put in your purse or pocket  i don't want a smart phone and this phone is exactly what i need  it does have a    month data plan with my verizon plan but the internet on this phone is almost useless  it like the internet on all phones over    years ago before there were any smart phones  the phone came from the seller in almost new condition and was ready to activate with verizon \n",

            "the phone came as described  brand new and still in the box  i was also very surprised at how fast it arrived  i think it was about     day  verizon had no problem activating it onto my plan and there were no hidden fees at verizon so that was nice the battery that came with the phone was not a good one and they had no control over that  so i had to buy a new battery and when i told them that  they were more than willing to help cover that cost  the person who emailed me was very sorry about it and he was also very nice i would recommend them to anyone and i will make future purchases with them \n",
            "i received this phone quick in the mail and seem to enjoy it so far  i noticed that in the pictures listed that there are removable hard cases to fit it yet i never received these extras  i did get all the chargers which is important  overall good buy \n",
            "this phone is amazing and all but buying it used is nonsense  the battery is poor and weak and the charging port is damaged  the back of the phone is all scratched up so i had to buy a case for it  if you want to buy this phone  don't buy it used because it is horrible\n",
            "love this phone  last of its kind  did not change my old plan  it is not a smart phone but offers  g  touch screen and keyboard  internet has great speakers  etc  so much better than the newer phones offered  that are offering less capabilities \n",

            "i ordered this phone from cellular direct  shipping was prompt  phone was new  as advertised  so i am very happy with my purchase  the only thing i didn't like was that the phone came with a generic charger not samsung made   other than that  it's a great mother's day gift for my mom \n",
            "i like this phone because it is similar to my samsung reality sch u     which died a sudden death unexpectedly  i did not want a data package and after numerous research  i almost ruled it out because everything said you had to have a data plan with this phone  but  one reviewer  helped me so much he didn't want one either  dealing with verizon which can be no pleasant thing  can be challenging  but you can ask to have the data package dropped and a data block placed on the phone great phone highly recommended \n",

            "i'm not into smartphones as i'm always near a computer and feel that data plans and such are a waste i only use my phone for occasionally snapping a picture or two  calling  and texting mostly this is my first phone with a touchscreen functionality so it was weird that i had no buttons to navigate  now that i played around with it a bit  i find it so much fun to click and drag i don't even have to give up the slide out qwerty this phone will automatically add a    mo data plan to your phone  you can ask verizon to cancel the data plan and block it on your number if you wish and still be able to use the phone like any basic phone \n",
            "i purchased this for my daughter this phone is good if you don't want a data plan thoughyou must go to verizon to activate without a data plan  it's great for texting as it has a qwerty keyboard \n",
            "this was my first phone i had bought off line  i was very worried that it wouldnt look new and it wouldnt work  but i trusted the seller and read all the reviews and i am very very happy  the phone arrived as described by the seller  looks brand new and i even got a phone charger with it  very happy and i will order again from this seller when i need a new phone  thank you \n",

            "got this phone for my daughter   she loves it  she is not a big fan of the full touch screens so this phone fit her perfect  \n",
            "i received this phone earlier than anticipated  it has worked great as my port was damaged in my current phone and my upgrade date is very close  i am actually beginning to like it more than my original \n",

            "i was trying to find a phone that did not require a data package  according to verizon  this phone does require one  i had to cancel my order  but it was not the seller's fault  update this evening i have talked to three verizon csrs and received three different answers on the data plan issue  i am going to confirm tomorrow and update this review again with a definitive answer that is in writing   latest update i just had a conversation with verizon concerning this phone  according to the csr i spoke with  and confirmed by his supervisor  when you activate this phone  they will automatically add a      data plan that covers   mb of data  however  you can request that the data plan be removed and that a data block be placed on the phone the latest information satisfies my concerns and i have requested that the seller rescind my cancellation request and ship the phone  i will be back later after i activate the phone to let you know how my wife likes it  stay tuned \n",
            "so when i was looking to order a new used phone the one that i ended up ordering said that it was a city red samsung reality in  like new condition   however when it arrvied it has a majorly beat up screen  the cover for the power cord is missing  when you look at the battery it has had water damage  in short it has had a rough life  also it is piano black  not city red which is fine but it would have been nice to know  it does work and with a new cover it looks fine  still i would have rather spent    more dollars and had a phone that was in better condition \n",

            "they send me phone that didn't work that was pass used i had to pay to send them back they took    more days to give me my money back they didn't ask me if they could send out new phone or anything \n",
            "sent this back it was even more crap then the one we had seller shipped it fast though      on shipping      on quality  defiantly was not new or like new \n",

            "i've only been using this phone for a few days but so far i'm really happy with my choice  texting is easy and i love that it groups texts by name  this is a feature mostly seen with just the smart phones  as a another reviewer mentioned  this phone does not need a data plan  which is one of the reasons i bought it  i just needed a phone for calling and texting  unfortunately verizon doesn't offer much in the way of basic or multimedia phones so i had to buy this used  i would have gave this five stars but the phone sticks when i slide it open  i attribute this to the fact that it is used though in nearly new condition \n",
            "the phone is working great  i have no problems with it  unfortunately there were more damages done to the screen than i thought  the screen has a lot of scuffs scratches  the screen looks like a used screen protector that's been used for a long time  when i slide the phone up to get the keyboard it doesn't slide smoothly it's a bit ruff  but the phone is great like i said before  it works just fine \n",

            "the phone i bought was over hundred dollars and it was a birthday present meant for my mother  she got the phone activated and it worked for about a week  then out of no where it started freezing  the buttons didn't work  she could not pick up phone calls  read text messages or anything i am severely disappointed with this product especially since i spent over hundred something dollars on such an up to date phone  there had to be something that went wrong with this phone with a previous owner or the previous damage done was not fixable or even able to be hidden  i am severely disappointed and would like to have a refund  but there is no point  i don't want another phone from this seller because i no longer trust this seller  i have bought phones before from amazon among other sellers on this website  and i have never ever had one single problem or glitch happen with any of the phones i've ever bought  i am very upset and now my mother is left without a phone because of poor service and an untrustworthy seller \n",
            "nice product and features  for a basic phone it performs as it should  and the slide out keyboard is definitely a plus  take note  however  some of the ads on this phone are less than clear  this is not a smartphone  but  for basic voice and texting works just fine \n",

            "i ordered a phone from here  because i needed a  new  phone since my old one died  the phone got to me a little later than the expected date  but that was because of the snow storms and awful weather not their fault at all   the first phone i received didn't work  i emailed them about it  and they emailed me back shortly after  they sent me another phone that works great   and a package to send back the other one that didn't work  their customer service and response time is great  they were extremely helpful \n",
            "purchased this as a replacement for my    year old after his previous one was dropped from the bleachers and the screen cracked  its a good basic phone with touch screen and slide out key board as he requested but isn't a smart phone  so doesn't require a data plan  came promptly and packaged well \n",
            "inexpensive  easy to use  keypad is a tad bigger than some so super nice to type not sure i like the touch part but that's any touch phone  miss the ease of the flip when talking cradled in my shoulder without hands didn't like that the headphones are different than the other phones we have  so now i need to buy one with a different adaptor  also for some reason it won't find my bluetooth but maybe that's operator error  so far out in the middle of no where it seems to work as well as my lg which is a switch  usually lg are the only ones i get this much service with \n",
            "nice little phone  no major scratches \n",
            "the phone arrived in great condition and was packaged well  setup was very easy  called verizon and only took about    min  works great\n",

            "the front screen fell off after   month of use  it was not a good deal at all \n",
            "the phone works perfectly  with no problems  the only reason for the   stars is a scratch on the screen  which i was told about before purchase  i would buy from this seller again \n",
            "the charger did not work  the phone battery was also defective  i returned this phone  it was disappointing because i bought this as a christmas present for my daughter \n",
            "got the used phone in a timely matter  it came in basic wear and tear condition  works fine  came with the charger  only reason i am rating it low is because there are scratches on the screen  and i think the seller should     inform about screen scratches  other little wear and tear stuff on the edges are given  and not an issue  but scratches on the screen should be noted \n",
            "the touch screen  touch  was not aligned with icon  the touch screen became totally unresponsive after   days  the phone was defective right out of the box  it was returned and the refund was quickly handled  i bought my u    replacement locally and the new phone works perfectly \n",

            "love the phone  it works very well and no problems so far  battery last a long time  longer then my last phone which was a sanyo  the only thing i wish i could change is that the key board buttons are so small i am having a hard time texting without errors to delete cause i hit more then one key at a time  other then that its been a great fun phone  u can get the internet on it if u want   has camera  great size screen for such a little phone  has cute wildlife sounds for ringer etc if u choose to use them  like frogs   birds  crickets  etc im happy with it so far \n",

            "the phone lasted   weeks and now we are sending it back with a bad battery  it may just be our phone and not the model \n",
            "this phone is just as much a piece of junk as the first one that i bought  don't get it \n",
            "the phone was very well priced by the seller  and was delivered on time and in straight from the factory shape  this is the second replenish i've owned in the last    months  replaced it because of a fair amount of banging around it took  while still deliberating on whether to stay with sprint the contract is up in december   i found it made the most sense for now to find a seller on amazon  in to avoid a new contract when purchasing a new phone through mobile phone co  again  good solid phone  good solid seller \n",
            "probably the worst phone i've ever had seems to always crash  it won't read my sd card half the time  says it's charging when it's not plugged into a charger needless to say i'm returning it \n",
            "this phone is well worth the money  good introduction to someone starting out with a touch screen  does not require the additional     data coverage but does allot more then the basic phone i own   \n",

            "probably wouldn't recommend this phone  the touch screen is a push screen and does not work very good i dont think it was  new  like they said either  it had a scratch in the screen when i got it and i had to take it apart to fix some stuff i broke about   weeks after i got it and there was stuff inside that didn't look like new the antenna was bent up and glued on and something else inside of it was taped on  it works alright but i wont buy it again \n",
            "this product was classified as very good  it was in fair to good condition  definitely not very good as advertised \n",

            "bought this phone from bsr cellular  they allowed me to swap out a phone i wasn't completely satisfied with for free  the phone does its job  i've also had an lg envy touch  i like the envy touch just a little better  the main dissapointment is the use of a proprietary coard and lack of support for this device in bit pim  for those reasons i will switch back to the lg once this wears out \n",
            "neat phone for a backup or spare \n",
            "good \n",

            "in my opinion this phone was the last good non smartphone verizon offered so when mine broke i had to get another one  the only thing is the  refurbished  one that i have has a problem with  s  key on the keyboard \n",
            "this is an excellent basic phone   easy to use and many extra features not typically found on a phone in the price range \n",
            "i didn't expect a perfect used phone  it had a couple scratches but this phone falls out of your hand easily  so all and all i'd say its in pretty good shape  the phone is cool itself  mine can't seem to connect to the internet but that's alright  all and all    \n",
            "my son really seems to like this  we searched high and low for the smartest dumb phone we could find  he really liked this one so we picked it up  so far after about a month of use he's pretty happy with it  one of the things he really wanted was a great mp  player  unfortunately this isn't as good as my kin for playing mp s but it's serviceable  unlike my kin there are actually a few games on this phone so he likes that about it  i was surprised to see how many smartphone features had been incorporated into this phone  the ability to add shortcuts to the home screen is very smartphoneish and makes the phone easier to use  he wishes he could add the music player as a shortcut to the desktop or add specific albums to the desktop but the phone doesn't support it he has had the phone lock up multiple times  it appears to happen a couple times a week at least  he often turns the phone off rather than just silencing it when he's in a place he shouldn't receive a call so the phone gets rebooted regularly  it's a bit surprising to me that it still crashes so often you might wonder why i give it   stars despite these failings  it's really because it's one of the best dumbphones i've seen  granted  compared to a windows phone  android or iphone this one doesn't even rate   stars but if you're trying to avoid the phone company's exorbitant monthly fees for the privilege of using a smartphone on their network then this is a good middle ground  i like my kin better than the rogue i'd give it   stars in the non smartphone category but my windows phone is far better than the kin \n",
            "this was for our son and he loves it  he especially likes the touch screen along with the flip out keypad  we've only had it since christmas but so far  so good  we did have trouble syncing his contacts  haven't figured that one out yet \n",
            "i bought this phone as a gift and she seems to really like it except for the battery life which stinks\n",
            "mine freezes alot and the screen cracked within the first   weeks and it wasnt even my falt it fell   inches and cracked the whole screen  overall its an ok phone  good for texting\n",
            "my daughter loves this phone and the keyboard  she insisted on getting this phone as a replacement for pantech garbage offered by verizon  it has stood up well over time and has not had any problems with screen or keyboard \n",
            "received the phone in apparent good condition but battery would not hold a charge  contacted them and they shipped a new battery out without any problems  unfortunately that battery was faulty as well  i attempted to trouble shoot the problem on my own by replacing the battery and chargers with oem parts but it still would not hold a charge  i contact them to advise but they refused to do anything stating i am by far past the    day warranty i was over by a few weeks and they couldn't be sure i did not damage it even though i had already made a charging issue complaint with the company  they do not stand by the products they sell \n",
            "got this and it worked for a week had a ton of scratches on screen and you could tell it had been doped alot and when i got it it didnt have the charger with it do not buy this phone off them unless you want to waist you money  i did the refund and now i have to wait up to   weeks to get my money i payed that they received that day very displeased  id give it   stars but i cant \n",

            "my wife wanted a phone that was a swiss army knife  but didn't need a smart phone  after much research  i found the rogue  this device has so many bells and whistles on it plus a slide out keyboard  beautiful interface  takes voice commands and easy to set up comes with a wizard that holds your hand  got a case for it for protection and don't think it will require an extra battery  it seems to last a while not a heavy phone  but not light either  feels like you're holding a phone  not a toy  i like it nice camera and a dedicated voice command hard button  like the fact that the app dock can hide if you want it to  the four icons on the bottom of the display stay there  but the side dock that scrolls can disappear at a click very bright and colorful display easy to see  highly customizable  she loves it \n",
            "my daughter bought this phone and loved it for a week  after that  it wouldn't charge  we bought new cords  new batteries but nothing helped  we even bought a used rogue to use as a charger but even that one won't charge  save your money and buy a different phone \n",
            "awful service along with an awful phone  the phone was all scratched up  and was not functional  it kept turning off by itself and the touchscreen was horrible to use  the seller also did not reply to two of my emails  so i wasn't really happy about that either  overall i had horrible service and i'm not happy to write about a bad review  hope to get my refund soon \n",

            "there was a small ding on the screen and a scratch on the side  but besides that the phone looked great  the only problem i've had with it so far is the battery life  it isnt as good as my old new rogue but i guess i cant really complain since everything else is functioning well \n",
            "this phone works great  its easy to use and perfect for texting  naviagting the web  and is equipit with a great cmaera and lots of features  i would recomended\n",
            "well when i bought this phone  it kept shutting off when you close the keyboard  didn't pay no mind to it at first  then it got to where it would not come on at all  didn't even have it a month  who ever had this phone didn't take care of it  not very honest in your ad  won't buy from you again  amazon marketplace keeps this up  i won't buy from any of it other than amazon itself  people need to get their ads state with what they are selling and be honest  why rune a good site like amazon with the junk that people want to sell and pass off as a good item on the marketplace \n",
            "great looking and everything but the one i got was defective   when i slide up the screen to use the qwerty keybaord the keys p  m   the left arrow key do not work  i am ver sad about that and when i want to use those keys i have to close my phone and use the touch screen then slide it back up agian to continue using it  very annoying  someimes restarts randomly  this is the last time i buy a cellphone on amamzon \n",
            "the back on the device was impossible to slide off and on  maybe it was just that phone but the rest of the design wasn't any better  there were so many  too sensitive  buttons on the sides that it made handling the device too difficult  i sent it back \n",
            "i went to the verizon store and they couldn't give me a no contract plan with this phone  to be completely honest it is the verizon programs that i didn't like because it made the phone too expensive to use  there are much better options available \n",
            "downgrading from a smart phone to this  i'm going to feel the loss  however  it does the job  minor  annoying things  like the screen won't stay in during a call so that you can mash numbers as is pretty standard for calls to anything but a friend these days   and the flash on the camera doesn't work  if i take away my spoiled rotten  it's actually a good phone and serves the purpose i purchased it for  timely delivery  thank you \n",
            "the phone was advertised as new  when it came  it looked ok  not new  but looked packaged well  when we plugged it in there was no response from the phone  we couldn't even charge it up  the company did treat me well though  i was able to get my card refunded and when i complained about paying the postage for its return they even paid for the return postage \n",
            "i buy this phone because i use to have the same before and is pretty good is like the seller say on the post i don't know why has bad reviews for me work perfectly fine come with the wall charger and plastic to protect the screen i haven't see any scratch is like new i'm very happy with my purchase  i didn't have any problem with the activation i call verizon wireless and they help me that was easyi check everything on the settings and tools and is all good and best is you don't need those high cost data plans from verizon great phone buy one and enjoyed thank you neo's phone store \n",
            "the phone has some issues that can only be fixed by rebooting it  also so it sounds like people are under water  you have to end the call and restart it  the touch screen is off a bit  but in all for a used cell that came with no charger it works\n",
            "everywhere only wants to show u a smartphone  and all i want is a phone with a keyboard and no data  great purchase\n",

            "came in awful condition  all chipped and trashy looking  the calibration is soo off i can hardly use it anymore\n",
            "i stressed waiting for this phone to arrive  it's replaced an updated model the samsung reality   but so far i like this way better  there's a flash  so the pics are better  and texting is so easy  the condition of this phone is almost pristine  a great bonus \n",
            "it was cheaper than buying a phone from verizon and was a good pick for a pay as you go phone  and before i wanted a smart phone it was good because it was touch screen with a keyboard as well but still like the older phones \n",

            "overall  i really like this phone it's just that it's an older phone  so it's kinda out of date  the touchscreen is sorta hard to press at first  especially compared to modern smartphones  but after a while of use it's not bad the thing i dislike the most about it is that it does not have t word for the qwerty board  which i like to use as an autocorrect  and it does not automatically capitalize  i  or other proper nouns names  the keyboard on the touchscreen is in abc form  not qwerty form like on most touchscreens  but overall  i really like this phone and would recommend it to anyone who wants a touchscreen but isn't looking for a smartphone \n",

            "as a comparison to the samsung rogue i have an lg env  that i've been using for the past several months and consider about the best phone i've ever had  i had a chance to try out the rogue for about three weeks and like it nearly as much as the env  prosthe screen is clear and bright  the slide out keyboard has a good response  i like it a lot more than the one on the droid i used to have  but not as much as my env   the  back  button at the bottom of the phone is super handy  i really liked the scroll feature in contacts  as you drag down  a large letter appears indicating where you are in your contact list  this feature works better than the one on my droid  contacts are easy to edit and the list makes it easy to text or call  the colors used in the messages display made them easy to read through  the sound quality of the phone and hands free are acceptable  the controls on the sides of the phone were usable  i like the way you can pin certain often used features to the screen and the side tab where you can select other often used features to dock there for quick access  permanent buttons for dialer  contacts  messages  menu are conveniently located at the bottom of the screen conswith a plastic cover the phone's a little on the bulky side  but about what you'd expect for the price  the touch screen failed to respond to my desired selection about    of the time  i expect this would improve as i got used to it more  the screen would occasionally unlock itself  but it never pocket dialed otherthe camera was acceptable for the price of this phone  but the buttons and settings were not exactly intuitive and would take some getting used to  pictures look great on the screen and there are several ways to display them  the notes feature is acceptable  but the length limit is short  and i didn't find a way to organize the notes in the order i wanted and they can't be stored on a micro sd card  i didn't try the music feature or the voice commands feature for which there are buttons on the side of the phone  \n",

            "phones were not unlocked  we took them to   different t mobile stores and they both said the same thing  we tried all   phones  then we called at t and they price matched the t mobile price  so we activated these on the at t network  an extremely inconvenient situation turned out for the better in the long run \n",

            "this is the best phone i can find without needing all the fancy gimmicks  i want two things a phone and the ability to text people cry about the durability  it's a phone who cares  it's works fine and is probably tougher than the norm  if you're sensitive to volume and speaker and email performance  spend more and move on i cant speak about range and performance  it works just fine in the city  i work construction and bought a  holster  for it  i see no reason i cannot get all i need for two years at least at t costumers should be happy w itupdate        at t sucks  but this phone is still holding strong after drops and construction  i felt worth mentioning  you decide \n",
            "this one is tough and does the job  love the external speaker feature which makes it possible to lay the phone down  talk and be heard well also  really great for those of us who don't hear so well on the apple smart phone  great outdoors \n",
            "it's certainly as advertised rugged  affordable  and has plenty of useful features  i dislike the exposed buttons along the outside edges of the phone  which are constantly triggered when handling the phone \n",

            "i like this phone alot   you don't have to worry about it breaking if you drop it   the only down side is it is  g capable but i tried my data plan on it and found data will not work on this phone but a great phone if you just call or text also works with consumer cellular system  \n",
            "got it in two days  it was more than i had expected looks new with warranty  nice job thanks bill smith\n",

            "phone it self was great  however they pulled the orang out of the back of the phone so after a week of use  there was water in the screen and it was useless \n",
            "not unlocked     still has att stuff on it so it will not let you use any internet or any other stuff so i gave up  plus its very week quality samsung rugby   was much strong build wise plus it had att in there too but again did not use the internet on the phone too durability rugby   was better now im thinking sould i get the rugby   or no\n",

            "this is a great phone that stands up to my boyfriend's abuse of electronic devices  he kept the last one for two years until it finally did not work  which is the longest he has ever had a phone  ever \n",
            "works great and saved me from having another   year contract with att\n",
            "i replaced a samsung hue and samsung a    with this rugby phone  i really prefer the hue over this one  but since i can't use the hue on at t  i had to find another  the a    worked for me  but the screen finally died so this is the replacement to keep it from breaking the sound quality is ok  it is harder to hear  less clear then the a    was  and i get slightly less signal from this one then the a     the battery lasts about     days on idle  so ok the ptt is slightly annoying since i hit it all the time  as well as the side buttons that are sensitive  the way i hold the phone i accidentally hit the right side button which turns on the speaker  and when i put it away to close  i often hit the volume rocker on the left that causes the ringtone to go up or down it works for me for now  but i would change back to my hue if i could \n",
            "this only complaint is that the light shuts off on the key panel too soon  sometimes the volume for the ear is sketchy  requiring you to put it on the outdoor setting but the speakerphone works great and does not distort  it was nice to find this unlocked phone for a decent price without having to change a carrier you are happy with in order to get the phone at a higher price anyway with att \n",
            "it is a hardy phone  good for those who drop phones so far no problems  i had an older model that lasted   or   years and loved it  not the best for texting though \n",
            "great  cool  funky and classic device good rugged mobile for throwing down someone    long battery life and good cell reception\n",
            "purchased two phones and since they didn't work as advertised i returned them  my visa was charged with return shipping and a    dollars restocking fee for each unit  after that experience i purchased one from a legitimate store front and it works great the other one is a smart phone and again it works with no issues  lesson to be learned  beware of the supposed online cell providers who surprisingly squeak through the cracks  even at amazon \n",
            "just what i was hoping for in the product  we have an older model which is so durable and great \n",
            "i switched carriers and went from a cdma motorola quantico     to a gsm samsung rugby    both phones are designed to be heavy duty i e  a little water ok  dust and dirt ok  drops ok  the samsung has matched up fine as a replacement  it has most of the same features as the quantico      the rugby   has bigger number keys  bigger screen  and clearer visibility of home screen icons like date  time  battery level  signal level and volume  i do carpet cleaning for a living and need a loud ring  so far it has been good but not as loud as the quantico  there is a dedicated button on the top left side for  ptt  a built in feature  push to talk   it is a subscription based walkie talkie like option  i have no interest in it and the button is far too sensitive to being pressed also because of the button location where i grab my phone out of my pocket it gets pressed often  that part is just an annoyance  the rugby   has only a few ringtones installed \n",
            "its always show siginal bar even if u take sim card out its an unlocked phone but its doesnt work with any of the us sim cards dont waste money on this product guys buy black berry for the same price or cheaper\n",
            "the phone has an external ptt push to talk aka press to transmit button which is quite easy to depress inadvertently  that brings up a screen wanting to start a ptt activity  ptt is an optional  extra cost feature that lets your phone act much like a walkie talkie  you then have to cancel the ptt before you can resume what you were trying to do  as it comes in the box  the functioning of the ptt button cannot be changed or disabled maybe by rooting the phone  which is something i didn't want to do  also  the ringer wasn't loud enough for my taste  i paid the return postage and returned it \n",
            "this is the second one i have purchased  it takes a licking and keeps on ticking unless you accidently drop in water for along period of time  even so  you can still use it  if properly dried in time  this cell has a lot of features and if used correctly   you can do anything from gps to e mail \n",
            "the phone itself is nice  but we are not able to access the internet or receive mms messages  we don't know the phone password or pin code either  so cant change the settings \n",
            "bought this phone and at t couldn't make it work  said either the memory was flashed to another carrier or that the phone was defective  i'm sure this is a great phone model but this particular phone is now e waste \n",

            "i buy this cell  because i have to use it for my job  i broke the one my job gave me  because it fell off my hand and it was open and i stood on it  i get crazy  because i have to pay     to my company for it  i decided to took a look in amazon and there was it  i have that phone for       years and in one occasion it fell in a deep hole on the street full of water  and amazingly nothing happened to it  how many struggles that phone passed trough  but he never fails me  he always works even when it was broken  amazingly i kept using it to pass the order to my company  but for them  i have to give it back the way they gave it to me  not broken  and at this wonderful price  no way i m going to pay     to my company  this is a very good quality phone  very very very resistant  believe me  it's not a touch one  blackberry or iphone  but i love this phone  sadly i have to give it back if i quit someday \n",

            "this phone isn't working all the time  i got it for my dad so he wouldn't have to upgrade his contract but he isn't very happy with it  it doesn't want to work all the time\n",
            "i bought this phone because my phones tend to get broken and i wanted a sturdy device  so far it has survived both me and my toddler no small accomplishment   my only problem with it is it seems to have a hard time notifying my when i am receiving a call on average about       percent of the time   it's not a big deal for me as i just call back when i see i've missed a call and i don't rely on my phone for critical contacts \n",
            "i've had several friends use this phone on the job and they've all loved it  recently i had a customer who wanted to trade their smartphone in for a 'regular phone that makes phone calls'  they also wanted one that could stand up to use  this was the first phone that came to mind  it was simple to transfer contacts to the phone from a galaxy nexus  the buttons are nice and large which is convenient for older people  the phone is rugged and can hold up to use great buy \n",

            "i am not looking for some superphone  just something to talk on and text with that i can keep on me while working and this seems to do those things ok  i only have to charge it once every week and that is great  the ptt button  on the outside  however  is really annoying and it is a serious design flaw if it turns out that this cannot be deactivated or disengaged or whatever  as some people  myself included  get rugged phones so they can be worn while doing rugged work  and this button gets pressed at least five thousand times a day accidentally  i have yet to really attempt to do anything about this  also it stinks that it doesn't say who is texting you so you have to open the phone instead of just looking at it  this phone is worth the forty five bucks i paid for it \n",
            "the phone itself looked great  my problem was with the battery which did not charge the phone  because the battery was old  worn  used  the writing was faded on it \n",

            "finally received this phone after an amazon prime shipping fiasco in fact my amazon account still reflects that i haven't received it   the phone is better than i expected  it feels fairly rugged and seems as if it could withstand a drop or two  the hinge is much more sturdy than other flip phones i've had  texting on flip phones is usually a pain  but the majority of buttons on this one make it quite a bit less painless  perhaps one of the best features is its battery  it holds a charge like no other phone i've ever had after initially getting it  i put in my old sim and it started right up  it came with an almost fully charged battery  the box was also slightly damaged but didn't affect the phone  so somewhere in the back of my mind  i do wonder a little if this was used before  though it was sold as new i don't use the web features or the ptt  so i can just speak to its basic phone qualities  the only two things i don't care for one of the buttons is small enough that i often hit the  c  button and have to start over and i do not like the access piece to the charging port  seems like that part won't last  it is by far my favorite flip phone  it is not pretty\n",

            "before a couple years ago  flip phones were all i had  then i had a few smart phones  and decided it was time to get myself a flip phone again and leave all the things i did not like about the smart phones behind  i was rather ecstatic while looking for one  and i decided this one  since its unlocked i have t mobile and has a lot of the features i liked with the smart phone such as gps  browser  and weather information  i have had it about    days and now i am returning it  from the start  i found out because i have t mobile  the gps  browser  and weather information and all the other stuff really besides the phone itself and calls and texts did not work  so i paid for a phone for stuff that would be useful for me that i could not use  i talked to the tech reps a couple of times to see if they could do anything about it and their ideas did not do it although  i do highly recommend t mobile's customer service  i decided to keep the phone because i felt it still had much to offer  on top of that  i saved all my contacts from my other phone into a backup file and when i tried transferrering it to this phone  this phone could not read the file format  so i typed up all my contact info into a document on my computer  and then put the     of them manually into my phone  since i am quite busy  this took several days to do after work  another issue i had  is that i could not plug my phone via usb cable into my computer to transfer pictures or what not to it  so i had to take the sd card out of it manually  but it into my computer  and do that  which required me to take off the back cover  shut down my phone  and pull the battery anytime i wanted to do it  on top of that  it would not charge through the cable to my computer  only the home outlet would do it  my computer did not see that the phone was plugged into it at all  it was also slow  i have pictures of past work i have done i like to look at and learn from  make improvements in my head and what not  some of the file formats it would not read so i could not see them  but really  it just toke a very long time to scroll through them all  and then by name once i found the one i was looking for  it would take another       seconds on top of that to load the picture so that i could see what it was  the screen  though i knew it was going to be small when i bought the phone  leaves a lot to be desired when coming from a smart phone  another concern  it said    day battery life standby time  i do not doubt that  however  when i am on the phone  i would get maybe     hours total talk time before the battery would die  my last smart phone cheapest thing i could get i could talk for about      hours  which is a very noticeable difference  it had sub standard reception most of the time  and when it looses reception  it makes beeps until you get reception again  and it asks you the entire time you do not have reception  it wants to know if you would like to select a network  this is all fine  it is just annoying and should do it on its own  the real problem is that it hardly ever has reception  since it beeps at you when there is no reception  and it does not have reception often  it makes for quite the annoying experience  my phone was always on vibrate because of that  lastly  and why i am returning it is because it now has the white screen of death  i took it out of my pocket to check the time and about two seconds later  bam  white screen  i turned off the phone and shut it off and pulled the battery and all that  still  nothing  i do get a second or so of the screen working then it goes to white screen  the back screen looks like it would if the screen got damaged  but that is the lighting  and when the screens are off  there are no damages anywhere  and the backlite screen itself works for a second fine then shows that lighting effect after the second  i dont know what to think  but overall  it is quite upsetting  i will mention  the phone still works  i just cant see anything  so i am returning it  going to get a new battery for my razr  conclusion i guess  with todays electronics technology  i was hoping for a flip phone that acted similarly to a smart phone in how it opperates  but left out all the  smart  data like  stuff of the smart phones  becaue off the grid is kind of nice  it just is a pain  i felt this phone had a lot to offer for a smart phone  but i could not use it because of my service provider  to me though  even if its gps and what not was able to work  i doubt it would have been usefull because it is just a pain to do anything  perhaps for some people  this is okay  but i am going to go a different route \n",

            "bought this phone for my    year old and she hates it  initially very excited but soon realized it does not always ring  suddenly she will have   or   missed calls or messages but the phone never rang  texts sometimes do not come through until the next day and it does not allow attachments neither to send or receive i e  pictures or images of any kind  i would not recommend to anyone \n",
            "this phone damaged two sim cards  the phone locked itself evertime we tried to down load apps  we ended up returing the phone  but seller refused to refund because the phone locked on him and he thinks that is our problem not his  i am starting a dispute with amazon \n",
            "its small so easy to fit in a purse or in your pockets  i can listen to the radio and save my favorite stations  the only things i would say is a little problem is that you can only receive     mb as pictures goes nothing over that number wouldn't be able to download  and you also have to re size picture that you've taken to send to individual  you can't text while in a conversation with someone or surf the net  kinda weird but that's how the phone operate  oh yeah and you would have to delete text that someone sent along the way since the memory is very little for the phone \n",
            "i gave this phone a three star rating because the phone is super small perfect for an elementary school child with small hands i think that samsung could had made this phone a whole lot bigger than they made it i do not know who they were marketing this phone to  but the size does not work well for an adult or a teenager for that matter i recommend this phone  but only to elementary school students only \n",
            "the phone was a bit of a disappointment  too small  user interface not intuitive  non standard earphones plug  fonts were much to big for display size \n",

            "i have a friend who is really into hello kitty and i thought that she would just love this phone  she had her phone stolen about   weeks ago and she said if i found a phone that was of good quality and cheap  to get it for her  i found this samsung hello kitty phone and thought of her  i sent it to her as a present and she was so happy  if you know of anyone that likes hello kitty  this is a great phone to get them \n",
            "it was awesome for the kids to own  it was cute and pretty  a great gift for any little girl \n",
            "i bought this phone and got surprised with hungarian language when i switched phone on for a first time needed google translate in order to make phone working and switch to english  then phone was randomly rebooting brought it to local service to update firmware and then finnaly phone started to work fine in overal phone itself is completely ok and working just like expected according to specifications  and most important my kid is really happy with it but startup problems spoiled my experience with phone a lot \n",
            "this hello kitty special edition of the samsung star is just amazing from the great call quality to the screen resolution  i highly recomend this phone  i recieved the phone within the alloted time period  and when i started her up surprise the start up info was in german no problem  thanks to the wonders of google  i found exact translation instructions on a blogging website  i do not utilize the internet portion of the phone  as i am a prepaid utilizer and will not waste my hard earned money on cellphone phooey i use my ipod touch for that  anyways  it is well packaged and comes with a euro style plug with us adaptation  which is aewsome  it is a bit smaller that it appears to be online  which was a good thing  as i slip it into a pocket and don't have to worry about a big bulky thing disturbing my sitting position so  if you are procrastinating  just stop right there  get this phone you'll be glad you did \n",
            "love this phone  so easy to use for people who are not so techy like me  i love playing with it \n",
            "i got this phone to replace my old iphone  i did not originally think this phone would be as good  i just received it today and i have to say i like even better then my old iphone  it was easy to switch it to english and set up just the way i wanted it  it was also easy to import my music and pictures from my computer onto the phone using the usb cable and the software included  i also liked that the seller included an adapter for the charger so i can use it in the us since the charger is a european one   earphones for listening to music and stuff were included as well which is good since the outlet is different than the standard so i think it would have been hard to find ones that went  it is also light weight and small enough to be easy to fit in a purse or pocket with a screen that is big enough to see everything  plus it being hello kitty really adds to the cute factor  i recommend this phone who wants a cute little phone that is really practical with a lot of cool features for a good price \n",
            "when i first got the phone i was really frustrated  it came up with a stupid error saying that service was unavailable  not only that but it was in hungarian  i went to my service provider and they fixed everything it has been a really fun phone  i love the radio and mp  player  i highly suggest buying a stylus  it makes it much easier to use also plan on buying memory you can't use the mp  player or the computer software without it  memory can be bought pretty cheap here in amazon  overall i love it  i get compliments on it all of the time and because it wasn't released here in america  it is very unique \n",
            "from my daughter hi  i bought this phone   about     and i think it is gr  the only thing is that when i got it  the manual was all in hungarian and so was the phone language and i didn't know what   do so that is pretty much the only thing about it that i didn't like  the games are fun  the ringtones are cool  the camera is good  and i love that u can insert ringtones and videos and pictures on   the texts u can buy a protective thingy   the touchscreen so it doesn't get all scratched up  i used a hair clip   a stylus bad idea so i would say overall  this is a great phone and u should buy it \n",
            "i have had this phone for a month now and overall am very pleased with it  i do wish that i had been able to read the instruction manuel was unable to due to the fact that it was not written in english  however  have been able to figure out most of the features  the call quality is fine and i was able to send and receive txts right away  i am not able to send or receive pic txts or send pics to my email  but i hope that my provider will be able to help me with this problem when i take it in  the battery does not seem to last as long as my last phone a motorola   but i am enjoying the touch screen and am pleased with the camera quality  i did run into a problem a couple days after i got this phone i was getting an  insert sim  message even though i had a sim card in  but figured out that this was due to the fact that the back was on a little loosely and my sim card had slipped out of position  once i fixed this i didn't have any more problems  the company i purchased from was very quick to respond when i tried to contact them called and emailed me the following business day but by then i had figured out and resolved the prob  i am very satisfied with this phone and would def purchase again  and it's so darn cute i like the size  color  and design \n",
            "i love this phone i read all the reviews and agree it is a cute girls phone  it came with the adapter and was in english  i am learning more about it every day  if you hold it sideways then it becomes a complete keyboard makes it soooooo much easier also a stylis pen with a rubber tip makes it easy as well  if you want a one of a kind that not everyone has like i did then get this phone you will not be disappointed \n",
            "this was a birthday present for my daughter  she really likes it  however  after   weeks use  it automatically shut down and would not turn on again  too bad it didn't last \n",
            "the phone is great  just wish it was set to recieve pictures and send pictures on the t mobile network  this is a minor problem  that your service provider can assist with  after there help  the phone was perfect \n",
            "i love it cute fun at first i couldnt receive or send picture messages but i called my provider tmobile and they set up the mms multimedia messaging service and got that fixed  bad side i cant send my videos for some reason but i hardly use that funtion i can keep the videos in my phone i love it \n",
            "i was a little hesistant ordering this phone based on the reviews that it comes in another language  however  when i got the phone and set it up  it was already in english  i decided on using t mobile for the phone service  you do have to figure out how to set up the internet  it took me   days to find the right website to program for the internet  and now it works perfectly  check out     the only thing i'm dissapointed in is that it doesn't seem to have any wi fi  otherwise  it's a great phone full of a lot of features  i hope this helps \n",
            "i just purchased this phone and i love the look  however  the only thing i cannot do is receive or send picture messages  but im not complaining too strongly because i did read the reviews before purchasing the phone but on one of the previous reviews someone mentioned that they loved the fact you can insert picture into your messages so i figured maybe there was a way you can send or receive them after all  but i can't overall  i love my phone  it's loud  it's cute camera is very clear which is a huge plus  it has the radio and other cool features very easy to use  i recommend anyone who does not really use picture message to purchase the hello kitty samsung s      ok after a couple of i had to come back and tell everyone that i finally figured out how to use the pic msg  im with t mobile so i went to google and found  t mobile generic mms settings  and follow the instructions from there  they also have instructions for carriers \n",
            "this is a really cool phone  my step daughter loves it  as far as the picture messaging goes for t mobile you can find their generic settings by googling  t mobile generic mms settings   on the phone tap menu messages settings multimedia messages profiles create set name  call it t mobile mms and then enter the settings  alternatively you can try to find a nice customer service rep at a  real  store  they'll do it for you  it's not one of their phones so some of their reps might say no but it is your service plan  so they usually say yes  as far as the startup language goes  the instructions that came with my phone said to insert the sim card first  prior to doing anything else to have it come up in english instead of german  i noticed that afterwards but knew enough german to find the right setting  if you don't have a year or two to study another language  this is a goog time to try google translate \n",
            "decent phone depending on who you get it for  cant send pic messages and internets slow but for just a calling txting phone its cute \n",
            "excelent gadget  my daughter is so excited with this  is very smart phone  i like it  was made by engineer and designer i think so \n",
            "we received the package quickly and had no trouble setting everything up  the phone works well and looks exactly like we expected it to look  this is a great product to buy \n",
            "how do i change this phone to english in came in some language that i have no idea what it is saying i like the phone and would love to keep it but it is useless to me if i can read and think to do anything with it \n",
            "i bought this one for my daughter for xmas present  she likes it because it is cute  i don't  this reminds me of the samsung phone i hated with passion remember that wanna be iphone from samsung when iphone first came out   don't get me wrong  i am using samsung galaxy note for myself and samsung does make good phones  i think but this phone note that question mark   let's put it this way have i seen the actual phone with my own eyes  touched  and felt it  i would not have bought it ah  i relied on the reviews of the others too much many times it works  this time it didn't   my verdict is this phone is just not a good phone  only good thing in this phone is battery life in my opinion  i gave it   stars because my daughter likes it she is   yrs old  \n",
            "i bought this phone as a replacement for my old t mobile phone that had a lot of problems  so far  this phone is great one thing it doesn't say in the description is how small it is  but that doesn't stop me from liking it so much it's great for everything i need  one thing i would suggest is that if you're going to send mms messages or get on the internet  go here to tmoatt   com and follow the instructions  it's easy to do and they give you all the information you need \n",
            "great phone  easy to use and all  girly  requirements meet in terms of colors  logos  etc  only thing it needs is wifi\n",
            "i just like it for the radio  if they behold had radio i would go back to that in a heart beat  but seeing as all i use it for is texting and phone calls i guess i can't say much about it  it is slow to respond  doesn't take pictures and videos as well as the behold  i did have trouble hooking it up to the provider so i could text images but a quick call to customer service fixed that  from what i've gotten out of it  i wouldn't recommend it  go with the behold \n",

            "i love it cute  unique very easy to use  great sound and easy to send free ringtones from pc via bluetooth  i was disappointed to find out it doesn't have voice dialing  i just assumed that was available on all wireless phones now  also wish it had wifi  but i probably wouldn't do much more than experiment  i just switched from overpriced verizon account i've had for many years  to t mobile monthly with unlimited data  so the wifi is no big deal  besides the fact that i love cats  including hello kitty and pink is my favorite color  i think it's great to have an unlocked phone  this is first time a phone i paid for feels like it actually belongs to me and none of it's capabilities are blocked  much better to buy a phone with a few less features  but all features work  than to pay a lot of for all the bells whistles only to get it home and find all the features you bought it for were disabled \n",
            "i bought   of this for both of my daughters  it have all the functionality of an smart phone  but for my surprise it don have a wifi capability  is my fault i did not notice this before buying  i did not want to have a data contract attached to these cel  but i will have to do it that way \n",
            "love my new phone it came already set up in english  and it was very easy to set up the internet picture messages using the instructions on the seller's website  it even came with an adapter since the charger is european  very cute phone  thanks \n",

            "well  phone works great and touch screen was responsive  i bought it unlocked and traveled with it to nigeria and it worked with all gsm networks  delivery was fast  the only drawback to it is that the camera did not produce very bright pictures  probably needs a flash integrated to the phone  the phone easily gets scratches so you might want to buy a case for it  overall it is a great phone for the price i got it \n",

            "perhaps i'm spoiled  coming from a nokia phone with its incredible ease of use interface  but this samsung has been a total nightmare to figure out and this is me being a longtime gadget geek who usually doesn't even bother to read owners' manuals for anything tvs  computers  audio equipment  dvd players  mp  players  vcrs  digital cameras  etc this phone gets two stars mainly for its looks the case and the screen  it seems to have been designed mainly for the bimbo market  people who just want to have a pretty phone in their hands  the owner's manual is a thin and horribly useless joke  most of it is about how to use the web browsing  mp  player  and camera  simple basic phone functions  like how to access the keypad during a call for navigating voice menus are totally ignored in fact  when i first turned on the phone  it was in german and there is nothing in the damn manual about how to change the language  i had to go to google translator and translate each and every icon and menu heading in order to figure it out at least they could have been bright enough to have the default setting on english  which is after all the international language similarly  there are no instructions on how to turn off the annoying keypad tones  i just kind of stumbled across it i bought this phone mainly for its pda functions  which are passable at best  i do like that it's much easier to do texting on this since you can get a full qwerty touch keyboard when you turn it on its side  but overall the basic phone functions are severely neglected and ease of use is abysmal  i will give this phone another couple of days  if it doesn't finally  click  it'll be going back update            well  i have learned to live with this phone's many quirks and flaws  which would have been a far easier quicker process if the damn thing had come with a halfway decent owner's manual  sheesh  so i've changed my rating from   stars to   basically this is a good phone for sending text messages  it is most certainly not much of a palm pilot replacement  that's for sure  reception and voice quality are both decent one thing that i noticed  and now have grown to tolerate  is how often the buttons and functions lag  especially on the touchscreen about   to   times out of ten  you tap an onscreen icon and nothing happens the first or second or even third time  you just have to keep tapping it until the damn processor wakes the hell up and does what it's being told to do  annoying as hell at first  but oh well  as dostoyevsky famously wrote he was in a gulag at the time  lol  man can get used to anything   that could well be the motto for this phone  heh update          over a year later  it has held up well and now that i have resigned myself to this phone's limitations  i am finding that it does a passable job of being the pda replacement that i orginally had in mind  how through the built in calendar  mainly i am able to make alarmed reminders for myself  that is the main reason i wanted it  oh and the contacts list is reasonably detailed too  which isn't bad  but the main reason i am giving it a better review now is because i have decided against getting an iphone  ipad  or even android phone pad for at least another year while waiting for that technology to mature and the prices to drop  in the meantime  this samsung gets the most basic jobs done ok  i guess  though if i had to do it all over again maybe i would've tried a nokia  they usually have the most intuitive user interface out there \n",

            "i bought this phone after i broke my previous phone with ongoing   year contract  i didn't want to spend a lot of money for a new phone  but the price for this one was reasonable  it is handy and cute  the size is small  but i rather like the size since i can grab it fully with my hand and i think i will never drop it and break it again  i recommend this phone to people who need to purchase a new phone with their remaining contract period \n",
            "i bought this as a temporary phone  i dropped my galaxy note ii  and needed something to get me thru until its repaired  it works fine had to get a sim card from at t phone center free because mine has a micro sim card and this phone is just regular  but everything works great  it does come with an intl plug in cord though  but i already have samsung  so mine works fine \n",
            "considering its price is a great phone  it has a very nice screen  takes good pictures  you can search the web and all  but sadly  since it is not an android telephone  you can't have whatsapp on it  so  if you are use to this kind of social apps you better choose a different model  but if you don't this is a great cel phone \n",

            "i agree with daisy s review the phone is good  however the biggest con for me was not being able to turn off vibration mode completely so i returned the phone after using it for two days \n",

            "i am frustrated with this phone  i feel like it does not live up to the reviews    the idea of the phone using wifi is great  but does not work  it shows one bar when i connect to my very strong home wifi signal    the broswer is very hard to use if you do manage to connect  and very slow   can't send picture messages without being connected to  the network    people can't hear me  say my voice sounds garbled   and probably the most annoying thing so far  is the phone locking automatically  it makes it incredibly difficult to use the keypad while on a call  i did not realize how often i did this until now  you have to keep pressing the unlock button every two seconds  and then after you enter the numbers say during a voice mail call and put the phone back up to your ear  you end up pressing numbers on the keypad with your ear  i have accidentally deleted a bunch of voice mails this way    since the phone is european  as well are the games on it  i am afraid to purchase any of the games  as i'm not sure if extra charges apply for international payment money transfer i wish i had just bought a simple flip phone  this phone is more trouble than it's worth \n",
            "the phone came   days sooner then expected  once charged it works great  the only problem i had was not the phones problem  i could not get pic texts  i called tmoble and they fixed me up real quick  overall i love the phone  no need to pay    a month for internet i have wifi\n",

            "i had the phone for over a month now and it works great all the features work good  the phone's language was already set to english and the package included an adapter to plug the phone to an american outlet touchscreen is great  not too sensitive once the settings are set up  the wifi and mms work great the camera has a very good picture during the day not so good at night  it lacks a flash the only downside to me would be no flash in the camera this is why i gave it   stars and the front camera is pretty much useless i think that is depending on the carrier that you have but it does work if you test it overall very happy with the phone \n",
            "i got this phone in order to pick up wifi as many people do  it does pick up wifi because it is unlocked but the browser is horrible  usually after about   minutes of browsing it would stop and give a memory error  when i called a customer service center the keypad wouldn't let me enter the menu options  the camera on this is horrible too  and many of the 'widgets' you can't download with just wifi  for just over     dollars you can get the lg optimus t unlocked which supports the latest androhid     froyo with a great browser  another stupid thing about this phone is that the head phone jack is propitiatory and is not the normal    mm jack  stay away from this stupid phone  get something android based \n",
            "this cell phone is really worthwhile  low price and lot of features  however  it came to me set in polish and the user guide was in polish too  but  i quickly solved this problem just using the internet \n",
            "i really like this phone  however i hate the fact that once i received the phone i found out that it wasn't an american phone so now i have no phone because i somehow locked it and now i can't get it unlocked because i can't get a hold of the customer service in the country where my phone was made  american customer service tried to help me but had no luck  also some of the apps are in different languages that i cannot read and so i can't use them also when i got the phone it would let me receive picture messages but not send them and i had to get my mobile provider to send me a download so that i could send pictures  from now on i am just going to pay that much more to go into a store and buy one from them where i know for a fact that this stuff wont happen don't waste your time or money \n",
            "this is the best phone available for the price  it is unlocked and wifi capable and hence it saves a lot of money as you dont need to sign up for a data plan the phone looks nice and sleek and all the widgets and tools works great love my new phone \n",
            "i bought this phone mainly for its wifi and gps features  i was disappointed with browser and unnecessary question about loading pages from various servers  but the worst part is completely non functional gps  only after i received he phone was i able to find info that the gps feature is available in czech republic only  no wonder i couldn't change the language used in gps section  to make things worse  i could not even get gps coordinates let alone my location shown on a map despite using my funds for data transfers  the phone came loaded with some applications  most of which i do not need  the ones i would like to have like gtalk  yahoo msgr  etc i could not install  in general  it seems that the samsung os is pretty sucky and inflexible i could not recommend a phone like this to anyone  i have no idea what other samsung phones are like  but i think i'll just stay away from them in the future \n",
            "i recieved my phone today and it was packed well and in great condition  its a little different than the picture as i ordered the silver and black  but this one has orange on the sides i got a case so i am not to concerned   great phone and works well with my tmobile sim and memory card  over all a great company with quality products  i will do business with them again i did contact the company and asked to exchange  since i didnt like the color of my phone  and they informed me the color i got was all they had  due to high demand  they gave me a    refund and i am impressed  i will definitly suggest this company and order from them from now on  do not order from anyone else \n",
            "i bought this cell phone   months ago for my wife she is from old school and was a little worry about touch screen instead of keys  but she get use to do it very fast  now she is enjoying all gadgets  the phone works fine with local phone carrier costa rica  a little disadvantage is that some gadgets are not in english or spanish comes in russian but nothing that a smart boy can solve i totally re comment this device  it is a good phone for the price \n",

            "with regrets  i'm returning the samsung monte because of sporadic network service issues  the unit i received would show three bars one minute and no service a minute later without changing locations and using a sim card that worked fine in other phones  after messing with it for a couple of weeks i was convinced it wasn't something i could fix with a software setting otherwise  the phone was pretty much exactly what i wanted  it was great having wi fi available on the phone when wireless connections were available  i was able to use the facebook and gmail apps  the internet browser seemed slow but adequate  the interface took a little getting used to but there were certain features i liked  i have an htc incredible so i'm used to a good smartphone interface and although the monte's screen was a bit more sluggish than the incredible it was still a nice touchscreen  i did miss not having a full virtual keyboard but the t  predictive text worked well with just the standard number text pad  the text messages just had a standard inbox outbox interface which was not as nice as the threaded message display of most higher end phones  i liked the control i had between phone memory and the microsd card purchased separately   i was able to add custom ringtones easily  the volume rocker on the side worked differently at the home screen it would control the volume of the keypad sounds but not the actual ringtone volume but profiles could be switched easily enough i would have kept the phone if the network connection would have been more stable  my home doesn't have a strong signal anyway so perhaps someone living within a very strong signal area wouldn't notice the sporadic nature i witnessed  i really liked the phone and would definitely have kept it had the signal not been an issue \n",
            "i really like this phone  when i got it i couldn't get mms messages  everywhere i looked told me to look somewhere else  i ended up just doing the live chat with a t mobile rep and he messaged me the settings and i installed them  it was super easy and now it works fine \n",
            "its a decent phone for the price  the interface is good to  i purchased this for my mom as a giftand she really likes it  the display when dialing is big enough  others icons are small but she willnot use it much either  its a good phone for someone who wants some basic functionality and access to internet i am happy with the purchase and would definetly recommend this phone \n",
            "i bought this to replace my husband's blackberry storm he lost in the airport  he is so please with it's sleek design  he likes it a lot  so easy to use and surf the web too  a perfect little thing specially for a busy  always on the go and not gadget freak person like him \n",
            "el producto es bueno  lo unico que estuvo mal es el retraso en la entrega por falta de factura que no envio el proveedor  por lo demas todo bien \n",

            "the camera is sleek and seems to be a good purchase  what was not stated in the description is that there are   user manuals included in latvian  estonian and lithuanian  had to download the english version  and as it is    pages in a small booklet format  printing is out of the question \n",
            "very good phone for the money you spend i own it for about a month and i like it very much  it has all basic smartphone features ok  no multitasking and no query keyboard but definitely  a good phone for smartphone starters  no contract and money you paid is a definitely worth it i would recommend this to any new smartphone user or who's is looking for secondary phone with no contract only reason i am giving   star is its java based os  which limits you to do certain things applications  over all  i am very satisfied with the phone \n",
            "i purchased the samsung monte because i was attracted by the many features that this phone afforded for the price  i received it over the labor day weekend and i spent all weekend mostly configuring this phone to work with at t's network  i was successful  but recently  i have been trying to access the  g capabilities of this phone  low and behold there is significant differences in the frequencies that are utilized by europe and north america for  g  consequently  the phone's  g functions most notably the video call can't be use in the us  because the phone is set up for          mhz and at t uses                tmobile uses other frequencies that are not compatible w this phone  i am currently researching whether or not i can reconfigure this phone to the required frequencies  i will keep you updated on my progress otherwise i love this phone  i just want to get as much out of it as i can  comment on my review if you need help configuring this phone for at t  cddavis  bellsouth net \n",

            "basically i would have given it   stars because it's a good phone once you get by the frustration of it being setup in another language  the manual is useless because it is also in another language  this is not advertised as such  the gps is even in a foreign language and i have yet to figure out how to change it if it's even possible  but the phone is great once you change the language  this is a really great phone and the price really saved me a ton of money  i can deal with a little language thing at this price the phone arrived on time and in good condition but i was wanting to select the gift option and it was unavailable on this item without any explanation \n",

            "i just wanted a phone to replace my lg that lost its keys after repeated drops heh   this was about the same price as the lg was two years ago  plus it has gps  wi fi  and a bunch of other stuff the version i got came with polish documentation and polish navigation apps  still figuring out a way to get english versions of these but it really does not matter to me i can't really get lost in my little part of the world  google maps works well enough to get directions to shops and stuff i haven't really been to before the gps works fine  it takes a while to lock on to about five or six satellites before it gives lat  long  and alt alt changes fairly rapidly even if you stay still may be inaccurate  the interface is fairly responsive  it did stick on me once  and slow up a couple of times  no touch screen qwerty is a slight disappointment should have it in landscape in my opinion  a phone that works  has good reception  wi fi  and a bunch of other neat features  a few minor issues  not too shabby  if you don't want to spend a small fortune on an unlocked phone  you won't go too far off base with this one \n",
            "i have purchase this phone  and i'm happy with this  phone   great design light and easy to use   the only problem that i see is the reception of the wireless signal   is kinda poor   and maybe slow to charge the page   but and the resolution of the videos has to be the same size of the cell   that's mean that you have to reduce your video resolution with a program   just that    is a great phone  \n",
            "the phone works fine with at t and associated data plan  doesn't always get the  g  for  g  but always gets the  almost   g edge   took a little effort to program the messaging and internet  works fine with wifi  the power adapter is the same one that i have for my motorola razor so that helps a lot  the music player is pretty good has no problem locating my music files and i didn't have to indicate where to search   the gps takes awhile to get going sometimes  but it does work note use the supplied google maps trying to upgrade will back level the program and make it not work  there are some good apps  and the phone is pretty intuitive  nice looking  i bought it for the wifi and gps features didn't want much more feature or keyboard so it met my requirements  battery lasts   full days \n",
            "i found this product easy to use it has most of the features i was looking for  mp  player  camera video it is touch screen  above all i am very happy with the wi fi capabilities  that enable me to browse the web without this expensive data plan  i am satisfied  it is worth the money  i recommend it for someone who doesn't want to sign a two year plan \n",

            "i did not read all the detail about this phone before i got it and found out from first hand experience  amazing graphics bluetooth gps gprs and one of the coolest features is the photo editing software  if you ever wanted a phone that no one else can use beside you the security settings on this phone give you and you only access to anything making calls reading text or even viewing photos  over all it is a great buy \n",
            "my nokia pos phone starting giving up the ghost and i was faced with either signing up for another two year contract to get a reasonable price or pay through the nose for a non contract price after doing some research  i settled on the s     monte  when it arrived  i popped in my sim card and voila well  whatever the portuguese word for voila is  the language was set to portuguese and i had to fumble my way through the menus trying to find what i thought was a menu option  after fumbling for about    minutes  i had it switched to english and was off this is a great little phone for a couple bills  i don't have to sign up for the contract  and i can kiss off at t and go to t mobile if it suits my fancy the wifi is awesome  it's sad that us carriers can get away with forcing defeatured phones down our throats and force us into outrageous data plans  since i live in mountain view  i get free wifi within the city from google  so i don't have too much of a need for a data plan when i can use the built in wifi the camera takes great pictures at     megapixels  video quality is good as well with a decent frame rate  but not the highest resolution qvga   good enough for youtube or facebook voice quality is not the best  also  i had to go to the uk for a case that conforms to the phone design  it also doesn't have a qwerty keyboard input for texting  a couple small sacrifices for a smart phone without a contract  a steep price or a monthly gouging very happy with this phone \n",

            "i purchased this phone for a couple of months and to be honest is my first experience with smartphones  because it has taken me several days to get familiar with its operation  and i went from having a regular phone to this incredibly functional gadget and change has been a noticeable leap  its     mhz processor is quite fast and efficient  the touch screen is very good quality  sensible  scratch resistent gorilla glass   decent amazing definition and brightness  it's camera takes pictures of acceptable quality  and the video runs smoothly  the size of the phone without being small makes it suitable for carrying in your pocket without a problem  or the discomfort of smartphones largest and highest range and price android as operattivo system is very friendly and intuitive  easy to use and i love power because all you can do with a phone and more works great with the  g network from my country costa rica   simply insert the sim and voila  a few minutes i was conected and running properly  i did not think it would be so simple to be honest the only negative thing i could say so far is the short battery life when using multiple functions simultaneously common problem with smartphones as already mentioned in other grades here   but this is easily solved with an extra charger in the office and at home  and upload daily   jeje at last i can recommend this phone without fear for those who like me not being a fan for the latest in technology nedd the benefits of a smartphone that have a good average performance  but with several extra applications that allow you to grow and evolve according to your needs as a user   by the way i wrote this review from my phone  which i think is really amazing adquiri este telefono desde hace un par de meses y para ser sincero es mi primer experiencia con smartphones  debido a esto me ha tomado varios dias para familiarizarme con su funcionamiento  ya que pase de tener un telefono regular a este increiblemente funcional aparatito y el cambio ha sido un salto cualitativo notorio  su procesador de     mhz es bastante rapido y eficiente  la pantalla tactil es de muy buena calidad  sensible  resistente a rayones gorilla glass   con decente definicion y brillos asombrosos  su camara toma fotos de una calidad aceptable  y el video corre muy bien  el tamano del telefono sin ser pequeno  lo hace adecuado para llevarlo en el bolsillo sin mayor problema  ni la incomodidad de smartphones mas grandes y de mayor rango y precio android como sistema operattivo es muy amigable e intuitivo  facil de usar y me encanta ya que potencia todo lo que puedes hacer con un telefono y mas funciona muy bien con la red  g de mi pais costa rica   simplemente insertar el sim y listo  a los pocos minutos ya estaba enlazado y funcionando adecudamente  no crei que seria tan sencillo para ser honestos la unica cosa negativa que podria decir hasta ahora es la corta duracion de la bateria al usar varias funciones simultaneamente problema comun con los smartphones como ya lo han mencionado en otras calificaciones aqui  pero esto es facilmente solucionable con un cargador extra en la oficina y otro en casa  y cargarlo diariamente  jeje en fin puedo recomendar sin temores a este telefono para aquellos que como yo sin ser un fanatico por lo ultimo en tecnolgia ocupamos los beneficios de un buen smartphone de desempeno medio  pero con varias aplicaciones extra que te permitan crecer segun tus necesidades y evolucionar como usuario  por cierto he escrito esta critica desde mi telefono lo cual me parece asombroso \n",

            "got this for my son for christmas  saved about        over a comparable model from the t mobile store  one caution is the need for a micro sd card  if you want to use any app's  a card is needed since internal memory is small  no big deal  they are cheap  just be aware you'll need one \n",

            "i bought this phone after reading good reviews on it  and while the phone itself preforms okay  i say okay because the in phone storage is inadequate and even with a sd card i can't down load many apps to my phone because the internal phone storage wont allow it  someone said the battery life is good but i think it is poor  mine doesn't stay charged for more than a couple hours if me or my kids are playing games on it  i have since learned the reason that the storage is so low and the battery life is so poor is that it comes with many useless apps that you can not remove and that stay running in the background so they drain your battery power i'm actually surprised this phone is even allowed on the market or has not been recalled  the power cord that comes with it is extremely dangerous  it is cheaply made and because it has to be converted from the european standard it has two different prongs hooked together  they don't stay together very well and are very cheaply made  it comes with two and both broke very quickly  my five year old got a very bad shock and there sparks and smoke appeared when she tried to unplug it one day  half of it just stayed stuck in the outlet while the other half came out leaving bare metal sticking out to shock anyone who didn't know better like my daughter  i turned of the power and got it out  luckily you can buy power cords at most stores as it is a common one  so if you do get this phone be sure to throw away the cords that come with it and go buy new ones that are made for us outlets but the biggest problem is this  if something happens to your phone  and i just dropped mine and called samsung support they will not help you  this phone is made in china and the us based samsung is not affiliated with them  so they would not even answer any simple questions  so basically i have had my phone for   months and need it fixed probably a simple fix and there is nothing i can do about it  they did give me a number to the support in china but it is a international call like that is any help at all  thanks a lot samsung don't buy this phone  everyone i know that has a cell phone has something happen to it and needs help sometime  if you buy this phone you are on your own  next time i am going to buy something local from walmart or bestbuy so that i know i can get us support \n",

            "i bought one of these phones but this phone does not work appropriately does not work with  g banded and you say me that it runs in  g banded           but just runs in gsm  i have tested with another telephony  but the result is the same my telephony has hsdpa          mhz  g frequencies of different companies but the phone is not working for these frequencies this phone is working terrible how can you sell a product like that \n",
            "like the phone even though it's a  g not a  g according to at t i will probably buy another one i am using it in the us   i had to call at t to activate it  i am not really sure if it's unlocked since it did not work directly when i put in my sim card however  my sim card is under contract with at t  maybe it was the reason why it did not work directly the phone is nice and sleek  not big almost the same size as iphone   it's not considered a smart phone by at t  so  for    month  my data plan was switched to unlimited data which i love since my teenage daughter is the one using it  of course it's not hip for a teenager but throw a nice case in and who cares she can do the same exact things as on her smart phone text  email  internet  downloads  enjoy\n",
            "i bought the phone because it said it was unlocked and it would work worldwide  turns out that the bandwidth that the phone can detect does not support the  g network in europe  at least in germany where i live  i bought it expecting it to work properly and here it can only detect gsm signal  so all of the features on the phone work slower and i can't really use it like i wanted  so if you want an international phone do not buy it  if it is for the states i guess it is ok \n",

            "ok  here goes  i really wanted to like my new phone  since i got this phone i noticed a few quirks about it but thought maybe it was just a one off thing however these quirky things progressed to annoyance  the phone is slow to respond to commands  i do not have too many downloads on it as i thought those might slow it down  i have a memory card that came with the phone and for some reason the phone goes blank when i use the usb cord to upload pictures  sometimes while trying to initiate a function  the screen goes blank black  dialing is another problem  in the middle of dialing the screen jumps to the home screen or it just sticks on one number and the others become unresponsive  another problem is it gets super super hot  even when not in use  my daughter told me maybe my battery is swollen so i purchased a new one  same problem also the battery life is very low  during the course of the day with no special activities taking place on the phone by about four p m the battery is dead  with the new one  it has improved a bit but still have to charge it nightly  note i do not have internet to this phone so the only usage is to send and receive calls and texts  no music etc  nada basic usage  so after four months  not impressed another thing i forgot to add is that it keeps saying internal phone memory almost full when i have next to nothing saved on the phone like i said before  i use it as a basic phone  i deleted all incoming outgoing calls and messages  cleared the cache of the few facebook and gmail apps i have and still it says internal memory almost full and messages are not being received  stresssss \n",

            "i purchased this phone for a couple of months and to be honest is my first experience with smartphones  because it has taken me several days to get familiar with its operation  and i went from having a regular phone to this incredibly functional gadget and change has been a noticeable leap  its     mhz processor is quite fast and efficient  the touch screen is very good quality  sensible  scratch resistent gorilla glass   decent amazing definition and brightness  it's camera takes pictures of acceptable quality  and the video runs smoothly  the size of the phone without being small makes it suitable for carrying in your pocket without a problem  or the discomfort of smartphones largest and highest range and price android as operattivo system is very friendly and intuitive  easy to use and i love power because all you can do with a phone and more works great with the  g network from my country costa rica   simply insert the sim and voila  a few minutes i was conected and running properly  i did not think it would be so simple to be honest the only negative thing i could say so far is the short battery life when using multiple functions simultaneously common problem with smartphones as already mentioned in other grades here   but this is easily solved with an extra charger in the office and at home  and upload daily   jeje at last i can recommend this phone without fear for those who like me not being a fan for the latest in technology nedd the benefits of a smartphone that have a good average performance  but with several extra applications that allow you to grow and evolve according to your needs as a user   by the way i wrote this review from my phone  which i think is really amazing adquiri este telefono desde hace un par de meses y para ser sincero es mi primer experiencia con smartphones  debido a esto me ha tomado varios dias para familiarizarme con su funcionamiento  ya que pase de tener un telefono regular a este increiblemente funcional aparatito y el cambio ha sido un salto cualitativo notorio  su procesador de     mhz es bastante rapido y eficiente  la pantalla tactil es de muy buena calidad  sensible  resistente a rayones gorilla glass   con decente definicion y brillos asombrosos  su camara toma fotos de una calidad aceptable  y el video corre muy bien  el tamano del telefono sin ser pequeno  lo hace adecuado para llevarlo en el bolsillo sin mayor problema  ni la incomodidad de smartphones mas grandes y de mayor rango y precio android como sistema operattivo es muy amigable e intuitivo  facil de usar y me encanta ya que potencia todo lo que puedes hacer con un telefono y mas funciona muy bien con la red  g de mi pais venezuela   simplemente insertar el sim y listo  a los pocos minutos ya estaba enlazado y funcionando adecudamente  no crei que seria tan sencillo para ser honestos la unica cosa negativa que podria decir hasta ahora es la corta duracion de la bateria al usar varias funciones simultaneamente problema comun con los smartphones como ya lo han mencionado en otras calificaciones aqui  pero esto es facilmente solucionable con un cargador extra en la oficina y otro en casa  y cargarlo diariamente  jeje en fin puedo recomendar sin temores a este telefono para aquellos que como yo sin ser un fanatico por lo ultimo en tecnolgia ocupamos los beneficios de un buen smartphone de desempeno medio  pero con varias aplicaciones extra que te permitan crecer segun tus necesidades y evolucionar como usuario  por cierto he escrito esta critica desde mi telefono lo cual me parece asombroso \n",
            "very disappointed and cheated greetings  i'm from venezuela  recently bought two phones galaxy ace this seller  the shipping came at the right time  but to get the phones to my home i realized that one of them was broken  the place where the sim card goes was broken nevertheless phones only have included chinese and english language  when i decided to take the phone to specialized technicians movistar venezuela  i was informed that they could not change the language because i had phones that were sold of origin china because the operating system is not what normally bring galaxy ace and they could not do anything to change the operating system of the phone because the system is not allowed and the saddest thing is that i have to stay with the phone because for me return shipping charge so much money amazon should do something about these types of sellers because they cause them to lose credibility so fellow of latin american and spanish speaking  if you are not good with english  because i do not recommend these devices and if you risk buying them like i did  then you can take the surprise you send the defective ones muy decepcionado y estafado saludos  soy de venezuela  recientemente compre dos celulares galaxy ace a este vendedor  el envio llego en el tiempo correcto  pero al llegar los celulares a mi casa me di cuenta que uno de ellos estaba roto  el sitio donde va la tarjeta sim estaba roto no obstante los telefonos solo tienen incluidos el idioma chino e ingles  cuando me decidi llevar los telefonos a los tecnicos especializados de movistar venezuela  se me informo que no podian cambiar el idioma pues los telefonos que me habian vendido eran de procedencia china pues el sistema operativo no es el que traen normalmente los galaxy ace y que no podian hacer nada para cambiar el sistema operativo de los telefonos ya que el sistema no se los permitia y lo mas triste es que me tengo que quedar con los telefonos porque para devolverlos me cobran mucho dinero de envio amazon deberia hacer algo al respecto con estos tipos de vendedores pues ellos hacen que pierdan credibilidad asi que companeros de latinoamerica y habla hispana  si no eres bueno con el ingles  pues no te recomiendo estos dispositivos y si te arriesgas a comprarlos como lo hice yo  pues te puedes llevar la sorpresa que te los envien los defectuosos \n",

            "this is not a bad phone  but there is limited memory and many apps do not store on sd card  this makes it run slow  also  this version has font problems with asian languages  if you plan to use in different countries  other than european ones  you may have difficulties even after installing local font software  samsung dealers in asia said this problem can be fixed  but at the risk of losing all data already on the phone  a nearly identical samsung phone  the galaxy cooper  can be purchased in asia \n",
            "i am a long time palm pilot user who is moving to a smartphone  and i chose this because i wanted an unlocked phone that i could use through net   or some other provider that does not lock you into a contract at this point  my phone works fine and i'm pleased with the purchase  however  it was not a  plug and play  process and i made one mistake  the description of this product didn't make it clear which size sim card you need  for this model  you need the larger sized sim card i think it's called a mini card from your carrier  and the smaller sized card micro card for additional storage optional   that mistake cost me    but not a significant tragedy in my case  the provider also didn't seem to know how to get this phone to use the data services needed for internet connections or apps without using wi fi  once i read up on gsm networks and saw that it's a  g technology  i remembered an option in settings for  only use  g connections   once i tried that option  i had could browse the internet the gps capability and the navigation app are very nice  it works well enough for me in the car especially with a slip case that prevents the phone from slipping around on my leg or car seat  it seemed a little rocky at first but i think that anybody with some tech savvy and some patience can get this phone set up  if you're not technically inclined  i'd recommend either going for a locked phone from a traditional carrier or finding somebody who can help you out \n",

            "got this phone for my elderly grandparents  they are very happy with the phone  very good quality and large screen and key\n",
            "i purchased this cell phone for my mom  my mom really likes it  rings are loud and front is big enough the color is beautiful \n",
            "no problems whatsoever with this phone  in fact  after i got the first one black i ordered a second one white wi fi b'tooth     good on both \n",
            "i am very satisfied with this cell phone despite the recommendations of others  easy menu  have a  gb sd card to store my pictures  display big enough for all i need to see with it \n",
            "i love this phone  my first smartphone  and i am very pleased with the features it has  it is a basic yet elegant phone  great design  size and shape  perfect for someone who is not looking to have a lot of features or is on a budget  awesome product at a great price \n",
            "this is a great phone  i have had a lot of cell phones but this is my second trully unlocked phone  it is a bit smaller than expected but still a great buy  capacitive touch screen is as good as any and maybe better than some  the phone memory is not great at all but i use external storage so it matters very little  the touch screen keyboard has a learning curve for those with large fingers  the free hand write mode is fantastic  only down fall with this phone for me is it is not voice activated and it does not seem to have speed dial  i think that the memory   it being non voice activated and possibly non speed dial should be stated in the description of the phone  i would purchase for a family member or friend\n",
            "the menu button didn't work after three months later  but the seller refused to fix it even they said it's us warranty in the title  i tried to contact the samsung custom service to fix it  but they said my cellphone is not sold in us and it do not have the warranty  therefore  i don't recommend to buy this cell phone  there are at least one year warranty for any electronics if you buy it locally \n",
            "cover basic functions of a smart phone but i didn't like so much de interface  i notice some trouble with de touch screen as well  i did like the design size  color and weigh of this phone  i think i would spend a little more money and try to buy a better smart phone next time \n",
            "if you want to save money on the purchase of an expensive cell phone  this is a good buy  it comes with a battery  charger and usb cable and had i not known i was buying a used phone  i would have thought it was new  free shipping is a plus  also  i will certainly consider this source again next time i am looking for a cell phone the phone is unlocked so can be used with the sim card of any service supplier  whether in the us or outside  i purchased this as a gift for someone in the dominican republic and there was no trouble getting service from a local supplier the phone requires a micro sd card if you want to save music and photos  etc  that does not come with the phone so should be purchased at same time  unless you already have a card you can move from another phone \n",
            "this mobile has good functions and seems like iphone  s  lol  the camera's effect is amazing  you can search free wifi by this mobile  recommend it \n",
            "this phone is really good  the screen is capacitive  unlike the previous samsung star  so it's really easy to use  the music player is great  and the phone supports multi tasking though it drags the performance down a bit   perhaps my favorite feature about this phone is the wifi  for those of you who don't have a data plan  and don't plan on getting one for the future  the wifi is a really nice touch because it allows you to browse the internet without being forced in a   year contract  most of the phone that have wifi are smartphone  which carriers are requiring a data plan with  but this phone is a feature phone  wifi is a great  feature  on a  dumbphone   the only problem i have with this phone is the annoying qwerty keypad while texting  the keys are really small  and i frequently press the  back  key instead of the  backspace  key  i'm getting used to it though  and it's also helpful that this phone has a feature that is similar to android's  swype   where you slide your finger across the keyboard to type  the internet browser is good  and the phone supports youtube videos  the quality isn't the greatest for videos that have a lot of action  but for the occasional stand up comedian video  this phone performs sufficiently  the phone sports a micro sd card slot  so i can load all my music on the card and play it on the phone  i have at t in the us  and the phone started working immediately after i put the sim card in it  the batter life is above average  but it doesn't blow you away  overall  i'm very happy with this phone \n",
            "junk\n",
            "muy bueno\n",
            "not a very simple phone to use  very old basic kind of phone  is not as simple and basic as it should be  i bought it for my mom so she can use to only make phone calls and occasionally text but it is a hassle  within   weeks the touch screen became non responsive  this phone should no longer be made and sold unless you like the old classic phone and stuck in those times and ways then this phone will not surprise you \n",
            "thanks \n",
            "nothing works right and it has a mind of its own\n",
            "want to start off by introducing myself  i am a    year old male who enjoys technology  i am not a heavy user maybe    minutes a day using my phone except for     hours playing music   but i do spend very many hours with a new device learning every nook and cranny of it as quickly as possible this phone is a very interesting phone  the layout is very similar to a smartphone  however it is not a smartphone at all  it is what is called a feature phone one of the smartest and most advanced ones made as of       it feels a bit smallish  to give you an idea of the size of the screen  take a  x  index card the kind with lines and fold it in thirds    angle to the lines   now cut off one of the thirds and trim off the top of the card along the red line  this is the exact size of the screen    stars for screen size  it's way too small  the battery life though  probably due in part to the screen size and basic ness of the phone  is incredible if you use your phone heavily  as in all day long from  am until midnight  you can use it all day without a charge  if you don't use your phone much  it can go many days without a charge  i think i have had up to about   days on my phone  but i tend to have it running a good bit for music over headphones    stars for the battery life here is a list of the built in features texting conversation layout  relies on the memory capacity of the phone's built in storage  if you intend to text on this phone but also have media stored on it too  purchase a memory card it supports multimedia messages  i am running t mobile on it and i have not been able to successfully send any multimedia as of yet  i can however receive all of them  this is a carrier problem  not a phone problem  the touch screen keyboard however is very difficult to use  i love touchscreens i have an ipod touch  an iphone  and have handled many many different smartphones  this is the most difficult touchscreen keyboard i have ever used  it can be used but it is difficult and will slow you down  use with patience  calibration at least with this phone may be off slightly and differs with each key  small size doesn't help any  it is not impossible to use and i have gotten significantly better with it over the past month    stars for texting and keyboard  calling supports   way calling  however i have never needed to use this feature so i cannot review this feature  calling is pretty good but not excellent  at times especially at the beginning of a call i can faintly hear my voice with varying lag times  from nearly at the same time  to up to a second behind    stars for calling  connectivity  yes it has wifi  it's good  however it will not be anything different than its  g connection  and it's basic  g  nothing fancy  not too fast but works okay    stars for connectivity  both for  g and wifi screenshots push the bottom middle button and the power button on the top right side at the same time  fm radio  a very good one at that  must use headphones for radio to work  it records too excellent quality recordings  very high quality  what you hear on the radio is exactly what the recording will be  in fact if you use the music player to play back your recordings  it has an audio plack mode called    ch  i don't know what that stands for  but it makes the tones sound deep and rich  i cannot gett over the quality of the output    stars for the radio music player  exactly the same look and layout of a samsung galaxy  it plays much better and significantly louder than almost any other feature phone  i have owned   feature phones in my life  this one is the best one for music    stars for the music player just be sure to purchase a memory card  camera  rear facing only     mp megapixels   no flash  it's actually pretty good for what it is  max resolution is     x      here is the resolution list in mp settings                        and   for     mp    x    and    x     the camera is highly customizable both before and after the picture is taken  it is full of very very many different editing options for one who has the time to fish around for the fun of it but they are all basic in nature  you can change color schemes  sharpen and blur images  even add basic clip art  words  and change font and color of words it is an absolute blast to play with the camera    stars for the camera web browser  no exaggeration folks  but it stinks  possibly the worst browser i've ever had  most sites cannot load completely  it says it has run out of memory  the browser is sickeningly depressing  one star  however  it can do youtube and it operates nicely on that site very weird the audio quality is somewhat poor and slightly garbled  and the videos aren't very clear and they are kind of grainy  but for how poor this browser is  it's shocking that it works it runs quickly and smoothly    stars for youtube  calculator  very very good for a feature phone comes with many features you can even scroll through all your old calculations it is however a european phone and the decimals are  well  commas  kind of different  but not bad   stars for calculator hands down incredible dictionary  lots of words  a few unusual ones  but chances are that if you are a person with a very good education  and you need to reach for the dictionary  you will only find your word half the time  the definitions are broken down into extremely simple terms  example complicated if you say that something is complicated  you mean it has so many parts or aspects that it is difficult to understand or deal with and then there are examples of uses of the word    stars for dictionary  notes  good for what it is for  basic  no need to elaborate    stars because of keyboard  clock  alarm clock  stopwatch  tasks they all work very well    stars  calendar  very good lots of things you can do with it  very much like an iphone calendar   stars  have not used twitter facebook or all that other social media stuff  cannot write a review on that email  plugged in all the correct information and it refused to work on both  g and on wifi  phone problem  not carrier or my fault  voice memos  works as good as any other device  they are all almost the same  records for    hours    stars i don't know  hard to say for sure  samsung apps and widget store  blah  stinks  very little stuff at all  most of it can't even be downloaded  sometimes the very basic site itself can't even load because it says not enough memory    star  games  can download and run any    x    j me app for touchscreen phones  expect only the most basic functionality of it though  the best place i have found for these apps is a place called umnet com  be sure to do your browsing on the computer this phone can't load that site  there is a download page the phone can use and it is umnet net instead  have fun    stars  but keep in mind  it's   stars for what it is designed to do  not for how good it is compared to a smartphone well that's about it if you are going to purchase this phone  here are some helpful tips  the phone kind of has two different screen formats  each with their own style  format  layout  whatever you call it  when you  slide to unlock  the first thing you will see is a background with these app lookin thingies called widgets  these make your phone run heavy  however they can be helpful little tools  these are downloaded from the samsung app store  these can be added and removed by tapping the widget button on the top left of the screen  a row of app icons will appear at the bottom of the screen  those are all your widgets  you can scroll through those  to open them  slide them vertically out of the row and onto the screen  to close them  slide them off the screen down into the little scrolling row  to edit the number of screens  still in widget mode  turn the screen horizontally landscape mode the signs add screens  the delete symbols delete screens  press the done button when you are finished with your editing the other apps screen is when you push the middle home button  these are all your real apps i wrote a review on  these cannot be moved to your widget screen  to leave the apps screen press the end call button on the right side of the middle button  when you open an app if you press the home button it takes you to the apps screen and the power button takes you to the widgets screen  many apps can all run at the same time  to force close programs  hold down the home button  tap the delete button to force close on any screen if you run your finger from the very top of the screen downward  it opens your notification and quick settings tab  you can turn on and off wifi  bluetooth  and silent mode from here  also if you have your music or radio running  all that can be changed from here as well change track  play and pause  and change frequency or pause radio in the radio \n",

            "ordering this i knew it wasn't in pristine condition  but this was still a huge let down  when it arrived it was scratched and worn all over this i expected   and had dirt dust stuck in every crevice that was unexpected   the charger was worn and nearly broken at the end  it worked alright for a few weeks  didn't hold much charge  but that is understandable for a used battery  it would occasionally freeze and require restarting  and the screen sometimes didn't load properly  after a few weeks it wouldn't charge at all  i tried an old charger that fit  and while it turned on one last time  it was barely functional  and completely gave up on me later that day i knew i couldn't expect much from a used phone  but this was still a let down and ended up being a waste of money \n",

            "this seemed like an ok phone for the three hours i was able to use it  it arrived with an initial charge on the battery  which allowed me to play with it for a few hours and test out the features  the touch screen worked well  but the qwerty keyboard was very small  which made texting difficult  i'm sure this is less of an issue once you get used to it  but i have pretty small hands fingers and had to correct one out of every four letters while texting  so if you have large fingers  this probably isn't the phone for you  other than that  it is a good basic phone  i don't use my phone for internet  email  or social networking  so i didn't try out these features  if you care about those features and like to customize your phone  definitely read the reviews  i noticed that a lot of people complained about not being able to change things like the screensaver i don't care much about that  but some of the pictures that pop up on the screensaver are truly cheesy  i didn't care for the standard ringtones on this phone  but i'm sure you can download something the real problem to watch out for is charging problems  when the initial charge died and i tried to charge it for the first time  i got an error message saying 'charging stopped due to irregular battery ' i tried it with several different chargers in several different outlets and got the same error message  if i tried charging it when the phone was off  i got a different error message  saying 'charging paused  phone temperature too high or too low'  though my phone was at room temperature  a new battery did not solve this problem  so i sent the phone back  in the course of trying to solve the problem  i did some searching online and discovered that many owners of this phone had the same problem some when the phone was new  some after a few months  some after the phone went for a swim  the phone i purchased was supposedly brand new  so it should not have had any swimming experience  i guess i'm thankful that the charging problem occurred immediately  when i could still send it back  rather than randomly after a few months like some of the reviews i have read i don't ask much from my cell phone only that it work when i need it  send and receive texts when i need it to  and hold a charge reasonably well  unfortunately  this phone didn't measure up and i'm not ordering another one  it's just not worth the hassle \n",

            "i am so disappointed in this phone  have been spoiled by my previous samsung impressions  the touchscreen keyboard is so tight it's near impossible to type a word correctly on the first try  i suppose a bad battery is always possible  but i have never had a phone that sucks the life from a battery the way this thing does i've started keeping my old phone charging a second battery just to make it through the day  my old phone could last     days never again \n",

            "i was disappointed in this phone  i ordered a car charger at the same time and it came within a couple of days and then it took about   weeks for the phone to arrive i was looking for a simple flip phone but this phone is really old technology  the phone would disconnect me in the middle of calls  i ended up changing from tmobile to verizon to get the phone i wanted after   days of using this phone \n",

            "i didn't read the negative reviews before buying so i also ended up with a locked phone  and i didn't find this out in time to return so now i have a useless locked phone to dispose it's hard to believe they're deceiving customers and still making a profit thanks to amazon  i just opened a complain with them  we'll see how it goes \n",

            "the software of this phone isn't that of a smartphone  but it is usable  what's disturbing about this phone is the hardware  the touch screen is terrible  the keyboard is terrible  and the back wont even fit the phone  i've only had this phone a little more than a month  and the back piece is currently chipping away piece by piece  you would think a company like samsung would put out better quality products \n",

            "for the most part i like this phone  i wasn't going to use the internet capabilities but i think i pushed the wrong button and got signed up  the touch screen is a little quirky when i try to scroll it takes me to whatever area i'm touching to move the screen  as with most other phones of this type  the screen disappears in daylight and i have to find a dark shadow to read the screen  i'd rate this phone b to b   for the money it does a good job \n",

            "a little about myself i used to work in technical support  although that is not currently my profession  i am able to speak intelligently about technology  my experience with this product has been so negative that i thought others would benefit from my feedback my decision to purchase this product was made after reading very favorable product reviews  my experience using this phone has not even come close to matching the expectations i had this phone's single greatest downfall is the poor integration of the software that was written for it with the reasonably capable hardware that is the galaxy s platform  the software is terribly buggy  requiring frequent reboots and causing individual applications to force close  the end result is a terrible user experience  especially when one needs the phone to  just work   following are specific issues i have had with this phone  i have no reason to believe they are specific only to my individual unit i believe they would be common to this entire product line   there is no fm radio  i suppose i could have found this out prior to purchasing the phone  but i expected that fm radio was part of the standard android specification  not so on this phone  perhaps the carrier s wanted the consumer to use and purchase an internet radio application  along with the data that such use would require   gps has rarely worked on this phone  i have tried many times to use google navigate with this phone with very little success  telenav is loaded on the phone but it is a paid app  and i refuse to use a paid app when there is a free app that works or should work just as well   phone frequently hangs and becomes non responsive  requiring me to remove the battery and reboot  this happens at random intervals  sometimes as frequently as once per day   phone is filled with bloatware  which i suspect is a major part of the problem  bloatware refers to programs the carrier or manufacturer wants to push on the end user in hopes he or she will spend more money and increase profit margins  often the bloatware is included to the detriment of basic usability after such a terrible experience  i was ready to defect and purchase an iphone  because at the end of the day  i need a phone that  just works   however  i recently learned that google is selling its newest phone unlocked and without a contract and without the horrible bloatware i described above   i will try the pure google experience and for now will attribute the problems i described above to the horrible integration between manufacturer and carrier on the android platform  i have ordered the google nexus and intend to update this review after i have some experience using it \n",

            "hello i'm a first time smart phone user and obviously the biggest question was to choose iphone or android and which phone in android after thorough research of available options  my expectations and reading reviews about various phones plans  i preferred to choose android with gsm samsung galaxy s phone as a customer  i expect that i should be free not bound by any contract   don't want too much and yet get everything i could get apple definitely does not qualify even if i jailbreak and android is clear winner  android allows to keep my options open  i could gift this phone to my family member outside us  if i wish to too being new to smart phone  it definitely takes sometime to understand smart phone  i'm still exploring my phone battery is ok  it runs out fast if using wifi or gps is on or if screen is too bright  but i'm fine with charging my phone once a day  still  wish if battery could last more longer many reviewers complain about not having led flash light in the phone  but its fine with me because if i intend to take pictures  i'll use my camera over my cell phone  anytime beside phone has a decent   mp inbuilt camera and i definitely like the inbuilt widgets  very smart overall recommend positive review about this phone but it may take quite a while to understand how phone works best regardshitesh\n",
            "i bought the samsung galaxy s  g from worldwide distributors to put it on a new line of my wife's t mobile family plan i currently have an iphone on at t   i do not know much about android phones  but the reviews seemed to indicate that this was the closest to the iphone of any available  so far i like the phone  it is somewhat lighter than the iphone it has a plastic back cover instead of the solid glass and metal and feels somewhat cheaper  but is a solid phone nonetheless  i am getting used to the android interface but have a lot yet to learn before i am as comfortable as i am with my iphone  my only disappointment so far is that there was no memory card in the box although the box and manual said it was included also no sim card but that was expected although the box indicates that it should have one i suppose it was left out to make the phone cheaper  but it seems like a sneaky thing to do  now on to the pros and cons so far pros i love the beautiful large display not quite as good as the retina display of the iphone but close  works with t mobile my wife's plan with no jailbreak unlock needed android is new to me so it will be a new learning experience easy network data disable in the shutdown menu nice touch very fast data transfer on wifi have not tried  g cons cheaper feel  not as solid as iphone but then again  nothing is larger footprint new interface will take some getting used to\n",
            "this is an amazing phone i purchased this to replace my blackberry      because it was starting to act crazy  it got to the point where the phone would freeze when a call came through only to unfreeze when the caller hung up  finally fed up i chose to get this device  originally i was not interested in this phone because i was still scarred from the g  experience and wanted nothing more to do with android  after my friends found out i was intensely looking into the htc hd  they worked diligently to change my mind and steer me back to android  this smartphone does everything and more  i will be as detailed as possible about this device packagingwhen i received the package i found that it was very well put together  the box  of course  was open because the dealer needed to remove the sim card and to unlock the phone  otherwise the phone was pristine and looked like i had ordered it from tmobile  the items that were included was the phone  travel charger extender  data wire  battery     gb micro sd card  samsung premium in ear earphones  and the manuals  one thing i did not like about the charger was that there is not a wire attached to the travel portion so you have to always use the data cable to charge the phone  this looks like it's the norm for this line of phones  so no quality loss on behalf of the dealer  just simply samsung's poor designing  the back of the phone is a little flimsier than i would like  but that's all opinion  the weight of the phone is not heavy at all but is so sturdy that one would think that a metal back would make it a little classier  i have the samsung behold as well  much cheaper than this phone  and it has a really nice metal like back on it  overall  however  the packaging was very professional screenthe screen on the phone is a four inch super amoled screen  the colors are very vibrant and crisp with no visible pixelation networki have tmobile unlimited prepaid service  which is    a month  i had absolutely no issues in getting service started  i live in an area where my blackberry constantly stayed between edge and  g  never fully  g service so i had no high hopes for this device  however  i was pleasantly surprised when i installed my sim that the indicator was telling me that i was on the  g network  i have been on this network all day and it has not dropped bars and has remained a steady  g so i am thrilled about that  the hspa service definitely works and the connections are extremely fast  no issues in that department email setupi had a little difficulty setting up my email addresses on the phone  i tried fruitlessly when i first turned the phone on to activate my yahoo accounts and the server kept stating that it was not available and could not process my request  i gave up for a few hours and tried again and it did connect  if email is important to you  it may be a slight headache to activate but will run smoothly when it's actually configured  i found that i needed to set up a gmail account in order to use the marketplace  while it is not necessary to have a gmail account to access the os upon first turning the phone on like the g    you should take into account that to use this feature you will have to create an account  i still have not synced my student email to the phone because it's asking for features i do not have domain   in comparison the blackberry      allowed me to sync my school account with no issues and never asked for a domain  i just input the email address and password and off i went  this is a slight annoyance but not the end of the world messagingmessaging is pretty standard here  the setup and the color scheme makes it enticing to look at and operates beautifully  there are two keyboards on the phone swype and samsung  i am not much on swyping because i kept making mistakes and that is slightly agitating  i changed the keyboard to samsung standard and my headache of texting went away call leveli found that there were no issues on the calls that i placed  i heard no static  the calls didn't drop and that's all one could ask for  this phone does support wifi calls  i made a few calls on wifi and also found no issues in the quality bluetoothit took me less than a minute to sync my bluetooth with this phone  the phone found the device in about five seconds  found the password ota and entered it for me and then connected  i was shocked at how fast and effortless it was browserthe internet browser is really decent  i was able to go to every site that i attempted with no issues  this phone has adobe flash embedded in the browser so therefore you are able to view video's within various websites without the video's being attached to youtube which is really nice battery lifethe battery life on this phone is excellent  as far as i can tell  i charged the phone completely when i received it without turning it on to ensure that i did not destroy my battery power before i even got started  i don't know if that's a myth  but i charged first just in case it wasn't overall this is a nice device and definitely worth the amount of money it's listed for  i have been looking at and reviewing the specs for weeks now and i am glad that i made this choice  i would recommend this to anyone on the tmobile network but i cannot definitively say that this works on other gsm carriers because i was not able to test other carriers  minus the battery charger  the back cover  and email issues i give this device a         edit june          this phone has a really nice  crisp  vibrant display but one problem i have found is when sitting outside in the sunlight you almost cannot see what's on the screen  for this inconvenience i am dropping this review down to a      what is the point of having a mobile device if you cannot see the screen outside which is the primary purpose of a portable phone another issue i have stumbled on is that the ringtone does not always ring  there are times when i have notifications when i turn the screen on but i did not hear the tone go off  for this to be fixed you have to turn the phone off and back on  i don't know if that was just my device but that has annoyed me a little  the ringtones are also a little lower than i would like i have been enjoying this device  but there are some issues one cannot overlook just because i like the phone  i still recommend it however if these issues are enough to agitate you then i would find something else  edit june          i never reviewed the video and music player because i had not tried them at the time of the original review  i typically don't use my phone other than for what it's intended for because i have a zune hd which is music and video ad i like to keep media seperate from my phone because of the battery power usage however i wanted to see what else this phone could do  i have  avi movies on my computer so i decided to sync some to the phone to see what the quality really looked like  i was blown away at how crisp the screen was when listening to the movies through earphones you have the ability to listen in     surround sound and it sounds like you are in the movie theater  i really enjoyed this feature  the mp  player was delightful as well  i listened to an entire    song album and viewed a   hour    minute movie on this phone without being plugged to the charger and my battery never dropped power bars  i am thrilled with the battery life in this respect and that the media on the phone does not drain it  very nice experience edit july         i took a mini trip for the  th of july to an area in my state that normally has decent coverage on t mobile's network  i ran into a lot of problems with this phone when i got into this area because the phone is provisioned for hspa and this area is edge  g  more edge than  g  when i tried to use my phone i continuously got dropped calls or my calls would not complete and i am not going to get started on the net service out there  because of the phone constantly looking for a  g connection it sucked my battery down rather quickly and my phone just wasn't working  i am glad that this was just a getaway and not where i live  however  it is imperative that if you are considering this phone that you go to   and check the coverage very carefully because if you are not in a  g area there is a great chance that you will assume that the phone bites when in actuality it's the coverage  not the phone  i am not too sure about the at t customers and how they may fare with this issue because i do not have an at t sim  but i would send my advice their way also  check the coverage at at t if you have that service because your sim will be hitting their cell sites  edit july         wireless tetheringi know this is a lot of updates  but i am still finding new options on this phone  so  i was in the android marketplace wanting to find a tethering service for this phone because my blackberry      had a tethering service named tether and it was great and useful while i was at work  i found the same app in the marketplace and attempted to download it  much to my annoyance and dismay it was not easy to set up  i had to download something called samsung new pc suite which allowed you to install the device on the computer and sync music and video's to the phone  while playing around with my settings i found that i was able to plug my phone into the computer with the pc suite  activate tethering on the phone  and connect to the internet i was not on my wifi at the time and i was confused because my pages were still loading on my computer  i did not have to download any  rd party tethering program and pay for it because this phone has a built in tethering program and no  i did not have to pay extra for that feature on the phone  here are the steps to activating the wireless feature    download samsung new pc suite preferrably an updated version and install the program    plug the phone into the computer and wait for the drivers to install  in which case you should receive the popup in the bottom right tray that says that everything installed and you should be able to use the phone    on your phone  hit the backspace key if you have a screen giving you three options which are for the kies firmware update  mass storage  etc  after you hit the backspace key you should be back to the main screen on your phone    hit  applications  and scroll over to  settings   click on  settings     tap  wireless and network   then tap  tethering     you should have a  usb tethering  option  tap this option so that a checkmark is in the box  in your task bar at the top of the phone  you should see tethering enabled  you can hit the house to go back to the main screen on the phone    if your computer is windows   and configured like mines you should see a little mini computer in the task bar next to the time  this will tell you that the connection is active  if it has a yellow bar next to it give it a few moments to connect to the internet  at this point you can surf the web no extra money to put out  no gimmick  just internet i am super glad that i was able to figure this out because i downloaded a trial and did not pay for the app but once i figured out how to get the app installed on the computer i was going to pay for the full app which was  like     dollars  that's a lot to pay for a feature you already have for free  in my opinion  if you run into any issues trying to install this then there are support forums that will walk you through the issues  i cannot say that this is the same process on vista or before because all of my pc's have been updated to    as far as at t i cannot say if they allow this connection because i also have no at t access but it is definitely worth a try  i think that this is a great feature and i thank samsung for caring enough to add this  and for tmobile not blocking my connection  because it's a lifesaver when not around a connection or a hotspot but have school work or something that must get done  edit july          seidio innocell      mah batteryon the      mah battery that comes with the phone i was ultimately able to squeeze out    hours of usage  from      a m to      p m  on heavy use  the problem i ran into was that i actually leave my job at    p m  sometimes a smidgen later  and i was not thrilled with having a dead phone to go home with  with that  i chose to get the seidio innocell      mah battery from amazon  i received this battery on friday afternoon  charged it from      p m to      a m saturday morning  i used this phone from      a m until      a m sunday and my phone was still at     this is after over   hours of conversation  non stop messaging  facebook messages and status updates  internet  youtube video's for    minutes  gaming and using the oi shopping app when i got off work at midnight and picked up a few things for sunday dinner at wal mart  calculate the time from      a m saturday til      a m sunday i did not touch my charger  i took my charger to work with me just in case and never pulled it out of my purse  that is    straight hours of power  and then some because when i went to bed at   a m my phone was at   and i could not kill the battery and trust me i did everything i could to kill it because i am still conditioning the battery and wanted to charge it from slam dead  however  i gave in and charged it at     there is no telling how long that battery truly lasts beyond   because i had to give up and go to bed and i needed a working phone later in the day and did not want to chance standby and a dead phone when i woke up   hours later  nonetheless  this is an accessory that is really necessary if you are like me and enjoy having the phone all day this battery is       here on amazon com and it's worth every penny i did a more detailed review on the battery page and like the phone journey i will be updating that review as i get more of an understanding of what it will be doing over time  especially next weekend when i am done conditioning it  edit august          less than   months after getting this phone it has begun to freeze on me and shut off in the middle of the calls  the dialer is forcing close as well  this was my main issue with the g  when i had it a few years ago  it forced closed so many times that i was forced to get another phone  i have not found the reason for the freezing and shut off but it has disconnected my calls at least three times this week and re booted as well as the calls will mysteriously drop with full signal  i am not going to throw in the towel just yet  i will do a little googling and see if maybe this phone is due for an update but if this issue is not fixed soon i will be forced to get another device  which i really do not want to do at this point  for these new issues  i am going to drop this to a three star rating and raise it back to four if i can fix it  edit auguest          roots and mobile access points  oh my okay  a few days ago i have been having issues with my phone cutting off in the middle of conversations and dropping calls on full  g signal strength  i went through my settings and realized that i was a  super user   now  i know that having a  rooted  phone does not mean that it will cause the phone to power cycle or drop connection  however  ever since i  unrooted  this device i have not had any additional issues with it powering off or dropping calls  for those who don't understand what rooting is  this is a process very similar to taking over administrative rights to your computer  only it's taking over ownership of your phone which allows you to download and install third party applications  the phones from this dealer are rooted and unlocked  so that's something to consider if you start having issues similar to what i experienced i also just found out that this phone is a wireless access point  which allows you to wirelessly share your data connection through the phone company with up to five additional wireless devices  i tried this last night with my zune hd and my laptop and it works beautifully  to enable this feature    go to settings   go to wireless and network   go to mobile ap  rd option    select mobile ap  st option option will not be active if battery dips below a certain point    activate wifi on the device you want to use and look for the network  usually named  android  with some numbers after the name i cannot definitively say that this actually work for carriers other than tmobile  because i have no other sim cards to test  but it's always worth a shot remember that mobile ap is a hotspot but that it also uses your data so make sure you have unlimited if you plan on using this option a lot  tmobile has no more than  gb of data  which is rumored to be unlimited but i don't know because i am somewhat midway through the month and i have used over  gb of data  so we will see at the end of the month if it is  indeed  unlimited \n",

            "let me start off by saying this phone is breathtaking  from the head turning design to the      x      resolution screen  a few thoughts display before this phone i have never seen  k resolution before with my own eyes so i only could imagine what it'll look like  coming from my former sony xperia z  dual i could always record video in  k but never could see it because what the smartphone displayed was only      x     p     p so after receiving this phone and after downloading a few  k videos and photos i can say i was not disappointed one bit it actually far pass my expectations colors pop  blacks are true and the triluminos x reaility technology brings it all together design just got this smartphone and already countless compliments  glass front and back the back isn't just  mirror like  it is a mirror which i find very useful when taking a   mp selfie but it'll grab up fingerprints like crazy i find my self having to clean it off a few times a day but it's not a problem for me becuase i always clean my phones repeatedly anyways  the chrome framework is amazing and i love they put the two front facing speakers back on the edge of the screen like they used to have it in the sony xperia z  models very simplistic  i didn't not like the two speaker placements on the z  models  on the bottom left side you'll find a laser cut xperia logo and   thumbs up for keeping the lanyard charm part in the design features sony xperia z  premium is the smartphone i decided to get over all the other premium smartphones is because it offers so much more for my needs that the others simply just doesn't  being able to turn on my playstation   from anywhere and play my games with a dualshock   controller and play all my console games on the go is great  holding the power button to show the record screen option and livestream my gameplay right off my phone with no added application is good all on the worlds first    in  k display  i've tested a lot of highly graphical games on here and it is a huge improvement over my old z  dual  games run great have never overheated once  i gamed for over  hrs and the battery life is so good  but watching videos a lot can drop the battery life pretty quick i'm guessing becuase it will upscale     p resolution to     p overall the shipping was fast the packaging was great in the box i got a pair of standard sony earbuds  usb micro usb cable  wall adapter not quick charge     which the phone do support   booklets  i have no complaints \n",

            "probably one of the best cellphone ever used  even it's over a year old  still performs on par with new phones that came out now  holds a very good battery life  although these days with pokemon go no phone can hold it's battery  but before that  can go   days without charging on a regular use  definitely last through a whole day screen is big enough  phone feels very classy  water proof definitely a plus  even as sony release the x performance  i would still use this  other than the camera  there are no real performance upgrade from the z p to the xp \n",
            "this is a great phone i quite enjoy the sony line exclusively  the sound volume is less than par but different features more than make up what thia phone lacks  definitely enjoy the fast processor  screen display as well as functionality  beautifully made and perfectly engineered \n",
            "this is not a good phone as far as running application and taking photos  and the battery life is excellent  but damn this thing is brittle  i don't put cases on my phones which was a huge mistake with this phone i have had this phone for   months and already with normal wear and tear there are multiple visible scratches on the back and one on the glass on front of the phone  i have no idea how it got any of these scratches and non of my previous phones ever got a scratch on the glass  so now i don't know if it is waterproof as i don't know how deep the scratches go  and waterproof was a main quality when picking this phone also the bluetooth is very sporadic when hooking to my car sometimes it works flawlessly other times i have to turn off the bluetooth and turn it back on and resync with my car  sometimes i have to do this multiple times  my previous phone didn't have this problem  the worse part about this is that it will play the audio through the phone which is muted so my audio books are playing in the background without me realizing it there is also a phantom touch that occurs on the top left randomly  so the menu on top will drop and raise and drop and raise  this is usually fixed by rubbing the top left of the phone but still annoying the fingerprint scanner works about    of the time for no apparent reason and the double tap to view screen is severely broken  this is the feature where double tapping the screen performs the same action as the power button  i had to disable this feature as it being in my pocket would randomly turn on the screen and just mash the dial buttons on the plus side  it runs applications fairly well when i don't get the phantom touching going on and it hasn't butt dialed the cops yet  this is my first sony phone and i probably will not be getting another one  again this is all the things i have experienced in just   short months \n",
            "this phone overheat so much that you can not hold it in your hand \n",
            "absolutely awesome\n",
            "this was supposed to be the best phone ever  so far very disappointed and looking at some of my friends' phones i should've gone for samsung  camera sucks  the pictures are low quality compared to iphone and samsung  when recording video after less than a minute the cellphone heats up too much and just aborts recording due to heat  as ridiculous as it sounds  i carry with me a second cellphone a cheap samsung   both on t mobile and the other phone has far much better signal all the time  this phone even struggles at times to find signal  i take really good care of this phone and now the headphones plug stopped working  screen seems to have a false contact now and blinks all the time  making it extremely uncomfortable and annoying such a shame and disappointment  i might finally switch to iphone or back to galaxy  good bye sony \n",
            "robert here i got my z  premium this past sunday and thus far  i absolutely love this phone  after doing much research  i picked the single sim international version as it has capacity for faster download  i'm really impressed with the sound quality of this piece  i'd been using an old droid  as my mp  player and using a cheap zte maven as my communicator with cricket service  i had to take it to a cricket store to get the mini sim cut to nano size free   being an e     vs the e      the product registration site wouldn't allow me to register so i had to call  it turns out mine was originally set for the panamanian market  the young lady i spoke with  alice  was very helpful with getting me set up for my   yr warranty i chose the gold color and it is so beautiful  it's such a shame i have to cover it up with a tudia slim fit merge case  the case actually is very nice though  i am really afraid of damaging this thing i chose the z  premium mostly for it's music handling prowess  this thing must have some walkman genes in it  i think i found a replacement for my zune with the cracked screen  i've read some iffy reviews regarding the fingerprint scanner but' i've not had any problem with it at all  it does not work when you first power up the phone and that's by design  the volume button location is a bit kooky but  i can get used to that  it seems a bit slow to sync with mediaplayer  i'm gonna try and use a faster port  i've also heard of people complaining about a lack of image stability  mine has it and it works very well  one cool thing i found with this being an unlocked phone is i'm able to use tethering on usb bluetooth and wifi hotspot with no restrictions this is going to be a rolling review as i gain more experience with it so  i will update later update           i've had my phone shut down reboot on me twice  both times it had been in my front jeans pocket  i bet it overheated and went into protection  thinking back now  i wonder if this is why i've had so much trouble with my android phones  i've had them reboot on me before and this xperia z  premium is the first one that's performed the same after  i think i like that  i'm still going to work on that pocket thing though  everything else is perfect so far \n",

            "i absolutely love this phone  i don't understand the negativity that some reviews mention  it is a sleek looking gorgeous phone especially the chrome version i got  the most amazing thing is the display  you'll clearly see a difference with its  k display  it takes great pictures  crisp and detailed  i'm not a heavy user and the battery lasts me at least   days easily  music on this phone is sony's high standard  coming to the software it is near stock android and runs smoothly  i was worried about getting this phone reading some reviews but i'm glad i went ahead with it  there is heating issue but only when you use the camera for a longer period but it cools down quick too  works perfectly in sync with the sony smartwatch    i use a clear case to show off the chrome awesomeness  this is a great smartphone and hopefully sony comes up with the successor in the next week's ifa \n",

            "probably the best phone in the us that no one has heard of unless you're a phone geek  i've had to work with phones for    years in the cellular industry and have seen many phones come and go  i have loved the recent xperia series from sony and always believe that they deliver the best products  in terms of phones  it's no secret that sony has had a rocky history to say the least sony ericsson partnership and a myriad of failures  i'll try and keep this short  but at least provide some more of a detailed review  feel free to check the other versions of z  premium chrome and black for others  but i notice the gold version is sorely lacking any thorough review so here go i've been using this phone for about month and don't typically review anything until i have had a chance to use it for more than a few days  first impressions can be misleading  so i let myself download apps  use throughout the day  take pictures  videos  etc and get a feel for the phone  i will say i have used a few other xperias before  i am jumping from a xperia z  i purchased in japan about   years ago and loved that phone as well  probably some sony fanboy ish going on here  but i will try and be as neutral as possible performance of the phone is fantastic  everything moves very quick and smooth  responds very well overall  one of my favorite features yes it's nothing new  but performs so so well is the fingerprint scanner  like i said  i have worked in the cellular industry and i know the iphone first brought this to the mainstream but i've really found myself using the fingerprint scanner a lot and the fact that the phone is larger  the scanner is actually a much easier way to unlock the screen than sliding up the unlock motion  and again  it just works so smooth perhaps my favorite part of this phone  and a big purchasing decision  is the camera  i have two little ones and whenever the family is out  i am typically default camera man  so there was a lot of debate with the wife as to whether i should invest in a good dslr camera or buy the loaded z p phone  i haven't regretted my decision as the z p takes beautiful pictures    mp  though i find myself using the   mp      format and even the premium auto mode is great for taking quick shots using the quick wake up mode   yes  it does take  k video  which looks unbelievable  and sony does have a little snapshot tool to take  mp screenshots of  k video stills if you so desire  the  k screen on the phone looks phenomenal  i've read a lot of tech sites instantly saying that the  k screen is unnecessary and a gimmick  however to be honest  i'm not sure what screen they're looking at  i've put up the z p screen next to my z      p and for me personally i can definitely tell a difference  the z p is so much clearer and the colors are very vibrant though not overly saturated   also  the camera has a     p   fps video mode which also works great  lastly  the camera has an insanely fast autofocus  which does actually autofocus  which helps with quickshots  again  camera alone was worth the purchase battery always a touchy issue with so many and always the quickest to get people to stop buying your product  with heavy usage  and again  from experience  i know what constitutes heavy  you can still easily get a days worth of usage on your phone  i have tried several times to intentionally kill my battery doing things that typically kill other phones instantly biggies being streaming video  games  gps  camera and the often under appreciated phone calls video data calls  i don't think people really know how much phone calls kill your battery  but again  tried to get it to under a day and it didn't really work  i would still have about    at the end say     pm of the day  now again  i don't have the luxury of literally sitting down from  am  pm doing nothing but that  but throughout the day  i would watch play listen etc and still had enough battery to do more by the time i put the kids to bed  also  the last few days i've been trying something else and seeing how the battery preserves itself  during work  i don't heavily use my phone because  you know  i'm working   but even at that with   email accounts synced up  and other various services running mind you  no facebook  twitter or other sns sorry no social life i still do some messaging but still have about    at the end of day  i do not charge the phone overnight  lose a couple more percentages and start day   with about         i then continue to work again and continue to drain battery and again still have a moderate about    battery  now again  by no means am i saying this is an end all guide to the   day battery phone  but again  for practical usage for people who don't live on their phones      i can easily get   working days of usage on my phone  maybe   if i push it  again many factors go into this  screen brightness  accounts  etc  but i have been thrilled with my battery life ok  i'm rambling too much so i'll wrap it up  quickly wanted to address a negative bezel never understood why people think this phone has larger bezels than others  i think there was someone who actually measured the of screen that the bezels take up and xperias actually have a better than iphones and some others  now one thing i will note is the   touch buttons back  home and apps are taking up part of the      screen  while others  like samsung have the buttons underneath so you get a true full screen  anyway  minor design gripe  but still more than enough real estate on the screen little extra here too  again  read about how some people thought it was such a novelty that the phone was water dust proof rated yet kept the charging port open  if you have experience with japanese phones  you probably know that waterproofing phones is very old news  almost all japanese phone manufacturers  sony  sharp  kyocera  make all their phones waterproof because many japanese take their phones in the bath with them  in fact  my wife has a basic sharp aquos from about         years ago that is also waterproof  but already had the open charging port design implemented  again  just a little tidbit there about the novelty of waterproofing phones  so yes the charging port is open  but the phone is still sealed  i also can attest to this as i have used the phone for pictures in not only heavy rainfall but also at a waterpark my little girl drenched my phone but totally fine  alright  i'm done now  hopefully this helped out and if you purchase it  enjoy \n",

            "so far everything is working fine urgent info the phone i received was configured in chinese mandarin so it needed to be reset in english which was a relatively easy task if you are familiar with the android os next  in order to use any mobile data for at t or t mobile you must set your access point for each respective company  this is as simple as searching the apn names for either and setting it accordingly or calling technical support to get the apn designation notes the phone is very slippery  i've never contemplated buying phone cases for previous phones but considering how nice this phone is i would hate to drop it  i am coming from a sony xperia z first gen which was ergonomically superior the camera is far superior than any other phone i've used with great clarity and fast enough to snap off some quick shots as others have stated the sound key is not in a good position but it may be an issue of internal space  it works fine in the horizontal position which it seems more suited to  the screen is excellent with no flaws spotted yet as with heat  i haven't noticed anything alarming  i've shot two   minute videos and it does get warm but nothing worse than what i've used before  it surprisingly gets hotter while on a call update after a few weeks of use and the latest os update  the heat has grown a bit but nothing concerning  the heat dissipates rather quickly when yo run you hand over it going back to the slipperiness  man  its like trying to hold a ice cube sometimes  it really needs a case or rubberized bumper  i tried cleaning it with alcohol  but nothing helped do not update this phone to latest update  the first received os system worked fine  there has been a few niggles with the latest software patch  sometimes the screen will fail to rotate on apps  and will only start working again if you restart phone  or launch the camera and open a picture only thing i've tested so far to get it to work   this has happened twice in the passed week and i don't know what is causing it  but it never happened before the update comparison against the new samsung s  edge  the edge feels significantly thinner and lighter and has more grip  this phone feels like a lead weight in comparison  this screen is a bit more vibrant in low light situations  but in daylight the edge is far superior  i personally like the bigger profile of this phone  but not when laying down trying to hold it in a elevated position  simply too heavy without using two hands  i figured the problem with the flat blueish tinge is not an issue with the phone  but the actual os  as it also appears to look similar on the edge  the actual application boxes and menus are poorly colored on this os  when viewing anything else  the color looks absolutely fine on both screens  with the xperia having a slight edge in clarity and sharpness  the s edge has a very smooth overlay and looks less pixelated in some cases  it's not until viewing documents and pictures videos does the ppi of the sony stand out  the speakers on the xperia is superior in depth and direction but not as loud  the s  edge does a better job suppressing bass which gives it a bit more clarity and loudness the camera layout is better on the xperia  but the edge beats it with smoothness and color reproduction  the default settings on the xperia is very bland  and takes some time setting it accordingly to get better money shots  the edge gives you a much more artistic profile strait out the box  the edge camera is also a bit faster  making it more stable  video playback is better on the xperia given the flat edges and larger screen  i don't particular like the edge for watching videos given the curved sides  lastly  contrary to my issues with the xperia being very slippery and heavy  i actually have a harder time grasping the edge do to the thin side profile  when scrolling through menus on the s   it feels much more wobbly and loose in my hand if weight is an issue i would go with the edge  this xperia is a bigger fashion statement and the screen is slightly better  but i would say the mirror on the back of this phone yields more usefulness   i've had three girls ask to use my phone and check out their faces with the mirror on the back \n",
            "i absolutely love this phone i just did a  forced upgrade  from my previous phone  sony xperia z s to this  sony xperia z  premium  the reason i say  forced upgrade  is due to the fact that my screen broke after about   years of service  i wouldn't have upgraded if it wasn't for that  anyway i been having this phone on my radar since it was released  so i bought it  seller shipped it quick  and it arrived ahead of time d the phone itself is awesome and the  k is beautiful the ps  remote play feature is a huge plus works great  a little laggy at times but playable  the chrome background is nice and camera is flawless  phone is fast i received a chinese version of this phone  and i am using t mobile usa  the  g lte works but does not display  but with a internet speed test you will see it is there  all in all  solid phone  and great purchase   stars \n",
            "it is great \n",
            "the product was in a factory sealed box  a lot of non english information included with the phone  but after the phone booted i was able to select english and it was smooth sailing after that  the box contained ear phones and a uch    wall charger with us spec wall prongs with a usb cable  the phone connected to at t without incident but in order to get connected to mobile data  i had to download the specs  this is done though the phone settings very pleased with my purchase \n",

            "i have been a long term xperia fan ever since i first purchases the z  honami a few years ago  now that i ahev the z  premium i must say that i am extremely happy with this phone  the clarity of photos and video are quite amazing for a phone  and the waterproofing makes for some added fun as well when i take this phone surfing and wait for a nice wave i just watch videos or listen to music  and the battery life is extrememly good as long as you have the right settings and with stamina mode you can easily double the time you use it now there are some things to mention since this is an international phone it is not capable of  g  but it capable of lte which is good because lte is actually faster  if you want a  g phone slower data speed then this is not the phone for you  be sure to set up your mobile network and to download internet and mms setting in the settings because only idiots forget to do that and you're not an idiot  or are you \n",

            "the sony xperia z  premium phone is one that will certainly get people's attention it is stylish  it is a beast of a phone  and above all  it is everything you would expect from a premium sony phone i love a lot of things on my z  premium  some are great upgrades from my previous phone  the z  this is just personal preferences  but i liked the walkman app before it turned to the android lollipop music app lollipop is just not type  i will probably revert to kitkat because i love the ui and overall feel better than lollipop's the power button is slightly sunken  unlike the z   where it was easily accessible with a slightly outward button lastly  and yes  this is was shocking for me as well  the screen with a whopping     ppi pixels per inch  k screen  you would expect the display quality to be as clear as looking out a window  so unless i bought a faulty phone  i kid you not  the screen looks pixelated  yes  you read that right  pixelated now  i know that everything except the album and video apps are down scaled to     p  so i tested the  k photos and videos  and to my astonishment  there they are still looking pixelated  even at  k  i had to look through a magnifying glass to see them up close  i compared my old z   my dad's z ultra and the z  premium  again big surprise  both my old z  and the z ultra pixels can barely be seen  with very faint black lines separating the pixels  while on the z  premium the lines were considerably much more noticeable looking at all three phones from a normal distance  the z  and z ultra's screens do not look pixelated at all  while my z   even from a fair distance  you can still faintly see the pixelation basically  i have phone with a  k display  but it almost makes me feel like it has a wvga display lastly  i've never seen a phone reflect dots from a turned off display before  my z  premium for some reason reflects dots  pixels  i don't know what they are in a squared grid pattern whenever the screen reflects light  whether its from the sun or any regular light  you will clearly see them  regardless if whether the phone is on or not conclusion the phone itself is awesome  great new features  great audio  superb built quality and respectable camera it might just be my phone  its too early to tell  since a lot people don't own this phone yet  but make sure to check with others who own the phone and ask if they see pixelation or have a faulty displays in their z  premium as well  asin b    gyngw sony xperia z  premium e         inch  k uhd display factory unlocked chrome international stock no warranty \n",

            "so far this is the best phone i have ever owned  i'm coming from a galaxy note   due to the note   not having expandable storage and disappointing me in almost every aspect first off  after using this phone i immediately fell in love with the waterproof feature  i will never buy another phone that doesn't have resistance to water  i mean honestly the technology is there  if the big companies cant get on the train and get this feature i will simply stay away  i also was able to easily expand my storage by    gb with a micro sd  the  k display is something i could live without but it is a nice feature and i can't complain  battery life is very good for this device i am able to fall asleep with    battery from a day of moderate use  wake up and use the phone till mid afternoon with no problems  charging is pretty fast also  i can leave the phone and forget about it for about an hour and come back to a ton of battery life i removed a star for the fingerprint scanner getting a slight scratch within the first month of use and rendering it un usable  would be nice to use it but not a whole lot i can do about it  i think the next phone i will get will have to have usb type c with super high speed data transfer  we shall see what the future holds \n",

            "i've been using this phone for a couple of days now  and after watching  reading  and hearing all these reviews as well as feedback from others  i had an idea of what to expect going into purchasing this device i saw a few have issues with the phone bending  similar to the iphone   plus when that first released  i've been babying it and taking care of the phone as much as possible  and in that time i've fallen in love  my personal experience is the ui is nice and clean  similar to stock android with a few added extras  and it's very responsive  i know it's not  k all the time  and until the marshmallow update releases  there won't be much support as of yet  however the up scaling of videos in the youtube app still look simply amazing  the camera isn't really want most hyped it up to be  but i find that it works well and edges out my note   and my father's iphone  s plus  which is perfect enough for me from the general feel of the build quality  i'd have to mark sony down as the  apple  of androids  since i haven't personally felt that the other android devices did it for me  i tried the note    s  edge plus  iphone  s plus  nexus  p  and multiple others  but the xperia takes the cake in feeling the most premium to me  calls sound crystal clear  and the front facing speakers  while not as powerful as some htc or motorola phones  still sound much better than my previous iphone all in all  love the device  hope sony continues to push out updates for it in the future  and i may stick with them should they continue producing this type of quality into their devices \n",

            "i have been switching from a phone to another for a while and the last phone i got was the nexus  p  i tried lg  motorola  samsung  htc  iphone  and nexus  p  i never gave sony a chance  because i haven't seen them doing any major advertisements so i assumed it isn't a great phone  when i used the phone  i regret not buying sony phones before  the phone is so user friendly and so clean of a software  even better than the pure android like the ones  which comes in nexus lineup basically you are buying quality a product that is well build and carefully crafted  and the software is perfectly modified the only thing i don't like is the finger prints left on the back of the phone and the lack of the number of cases available to purchase update sadly i returned the phone  because i was getting black screen of death during my calls  i can't do anything when i get it until the person i am talking to hang up then the screen turn back on  i tried all the fixes  but none of them worked  so i ended up returning it  i liked the phone so much  but i don't want to risk buying a phone that has a common issue since the z  \n",

            "due to some discussion about very different flavors of this phone being shipped by different sellers  this review is for a phone sent to me by unlocked cell phone kings inc via amazon  delivery was prompt and the item was in brand new condition if it wasn't they sure did a great job making it look that way   mine came with a very brief manual if you want to call it that in english  with the phone set to uk english  this is my first even semi smart phone  but i have some experience as an android tablet user so it wasn't all new to me i have several usb cables with male usb mini connectors  this phone uses a usb micro connector for charging and data transfer so i bought some mini to micro adapters so i could use the stuff i have  but the adapters turned out to be useless  the female usb micro port on the phone is recessed in the housing such that the male usb micro fits only if it will fit inside this very  very small housing  the adapters i bought  though small  were too big to allow the male plug to be inserted deep enough into the female to make a connection or even stay in place they fall right out   i'm thinking i'm going to have to get genuine samsung cables from somewhere but haven't finished looking around yet the power adapter  which has the proper size usb micro male on it  is a european plug design and it comes with a plug adapter  presumably so it can be used in the us  while you can indeed plug it into a        v outlet in the us with the adapter  it has absolutely no effect on the phone  it doesn't charge at all  i'm guessing it expects more voltage  but whatever  the cable is built into the transformer and so is useless as a spare data or charging cable  also  apparently not all charging cables will transfer data as well as charge  be careful when looking at charging cables or kits to make sure you get one that can both charge the device and transfer data between the phone and your computer  if it just says it's for charging  it is probably not for both purposes that means that this package contains one and only one usable cable for charging and data sync  via a standard usb connection on the pc side of things and a micro usb male on the phone side  you will probably want to plan to buy a spare or two but i don't have a recommendation on that yet because the usb micro female port on the phone won't accept just any usb micro male  it has to be in a really  really small housing i couldn't use the camera app or install the amazon app store or several other items until i put a   gb micro sd card in the phone all   gb were recognized   get an sd card installed before you start trying to install much of anything it solves a number of problems the android market and the amazon app store initially reported that several apps were not compatible with my device  i downloaded and installed samsung kies on my win   home premium    bit machine with no problems  then closed it down and started it again and it asked if i wanted to update it and i said yes  so it updated  and then asked if i wanted to upgrade the firmware in my phone  i said yes  after i did this by this point i had already installed the sd card   app installations have been smooth as silk  even the often aggravating words with friends which seems to decide that any device you have is incompatible about every other week i recommend you look for  app sd  or a similar application that allows you to move or which automatically moves applications to your sd card instead of letting them hog space in the limited onboard phone memory  some apps must live in the phone but others can live on the sd card i had trouble with the bluetooth phone application in my car a late model hyundai and found that others have too  i paired the phone with the car successfully and could make and receive hands free calls through the system with no trouble  i could not get my phonebook contact list to download from the phone into my car  though  after much aggravation and searching  i found a post on a board that suggested a free android app called bluetooth file transfer  download and install that app start it hit menu hit more hit send contacts select all or whatever you want hit send as single  the app blasted my contact phonebook list out into the ether where the car saw them floating around the car was configured to auto download and sucked them all in  et voila yes  i do have to remember to refresh the car's copy from time to time but i can live with that the screen scratches pretty easily you may want to consider a protector and oh yes  i bought a     mah battery because of so many people saying the battery life was lousy  at least for now  my battery life with the originally supplied battery is excellent imho with bluetooth and wifi on       but you always need a spare battery lying in a drawer somewhere this sounds almost like a list of complaints but i don't mean it to be  i like this phone and would recommend it highly  all i need now are a few cheap cables and a few accessories  which i always seem to need when i get something like this  it has taken about a week of on again  off again diddling to get it largely where i want it  but that's not unreasonable for a new tech toy  if you are new to android expect it to take a bit longer  but that's not the phone's fault it's just how it is  i hope some of these comments are useful if you are considering or have bought this phone \n",

            "i have a verizon samsung droid cdma cellphone  which is now my major phone line i use while home in the usa  i do  however  spend a couple of months a year in france  and while there have a gsm simcard from the french cell provider sfr  which i have had for several years and which i got from callineurope com  in addition  i have a t mobile prepaid simcard  which i've used in an old candybar style  stupidphone   which costs me around    with online discounts to recharge with      prepaid usa minutes  usable within a year  i have not decided long term what i will do with this t mobile service  however inertia is a huge force and for the moment i'm keeping it  and will decide in a few months if i want to  invest  another    to keep the line active for another year  one plus about the annual        with online coupons available sporadically t mobile prepaid recharge  is that as long as you recharge before the expiration period of the last year  you get to keep your unused minutes cash balance and roll it into the new year along with the new          minutes you just recharged with  for an occasional cellphone voice user  this does offer a lot of bang for the buck  especially for emergency or other occasional type usage  you can change your t mobile plan over the internet in   minute by logging into mytmobile com which allows you to change from      minute to a daily rate of   only on days you actually use it with unlimited talk and unlimited   g    g  edge level data service  so  if you were going to use this phone for t mobile voice and data on a sporadic basis  say    days per year while on the road  leaving it turned off the rest of the time  that would be a hard deal to beat  e g  yearly unlimited voice and data for     year if you don't need the service all the time  and you can change back to the      minute voice and text only plan when you want to on the t mobile website having become somewhat addicted to the functionality of my verizon samsung droid charge cell  i decided to replace the old gsm stupidphone i've been using with this small inexpensive samsung gsm s     smartphone  i figured that at the least i could use web browsing and other features that require a network on wifi networks as i encounter them  which would at least give me an updated google contact list plus my appointments calendar  as far as using this phone on data networks  there are a couple of caveats i have discovered and which i detail below i am not going to comment on the limitations of this phone that have already been discussed ad nauseum in online reviews  such as the small  low resolution touch screen  battery life  etc  at     unlocked as i type this  you are not going to get the features of a high end cellphone for this price  for the record  my phone came from the amazon seller  global mobiles   apparently a german company whose orders are fulfilled by amazon  it came with all advertised accessories including the charger european plug but with usa adapter   a fresh and recently manufactured battery  manuals in german  and a near useless  gb micro sd card  the phone was set up to function in english when i got it  and showed zero evidence of ever having been opened or touched by human hands after it was manufactured limitations on data network usage that i have discovered so far include   only up to   g speeds   not   g  there is considerable confusion as regards what is  g  what is  g  and how they compare  the executive summary is that although there are going to be differences in speed within an individual carrier's offerings of  g vs   g  you cannot compare among the various carriers because the carriers define   g  and   g  differently and they also use different transmission bands and technologies  there are going to be carriers who have faster   g  offerings that cannot be effectively utilized with this phone that claims   g  service but not   g  service  research your own carrier and what level of service you expect to get from it  before buying this phone  that could probably be said of most any cellphone out there    us t mobile has what they call   g  service and   g  service  which use bands that this phone does not have  you will be able to use this phone with t mobile  edge  service  which is variously labeled as   g  by some and elevated to     g  by some others  which is to say it has the potential to be faster than your typical  dial up slow  g service  however it will still seem very slow compared to a good home broadband connection or to any decent  g or  g service  from some web research that i did after buying this phone  it is obvious that there are only a limited number of gsm cellphones out there that can utilize t mobile's fastest data network s most of these phones are going to be sold directly by t mobile  and few will be available as unlocked phones sold on amazon or that well known online auction site  your best option if you want fast  t mobile usa data service would be to get your phone directly from t mobile and then perhaps find a way to unlock it if you want to then use it on another network as well for use in europe  this phone should provide reasonably fast    g  level data services  however the cost of such data service is very high if you don't have the sort of year round data plan that most travelers will not have  as such  if you have a pay as you go or prepaid plan from a european carrier or reseller from a carrier  you will probably elect to use available wifi networks for most of your data use on this phone  with perhaps email usage through the carrier's data service  for that purpose  the phone should work well and offer a lot more functionality than an old style  stupidphone  for my own uses  basically as a travel voice cellphone with some smartphone features  most of which i will access through hotel and other free hotspot wifi networks  with occasional cell carrier data usage for email  this phone is a good choice at an attractive price  i would not want to use this phone as my everyday smartphone  but for periodic or vacation use outside of my usual carrier's network  it is certainly a more enjoyable phone to use than an old style stupidphone \n",

            "this is the phone i was looking for  the flip phone slides into my purse  fits my hand and nails  and has the time on the outside  it fits to my face  like a phone should  the keyboard has three different screens letters  numbers  and punctuation  which are easy to toggle between  internet access if available  but slow  as far as i can tell  the calendar feature does not sync with outlook  but not a problem  that's why i have a tablet  this phone is for communicating  not surfing the web \n",
            "the samsung alias   u    verizon wireless is great for those in need of a rugged smart phone   i buy them for my employees who work in places where a fragile phone is easily damaged  one of the best features is the phone s side flip feature for quick texting  i suggest buying protectors for both outer and inner phone faces also available at amazon \n",
            "when i was in fernley nv at amazon warehouse and reno it was very difficult to get any verizon signal  then the phone died  this was not my first alias  it was an attempt to get certain features like a decent calander and phone book without going to a smart phone and mandatory data plan  i gave up and now have a note    great phone \n",

            "i wanted a messaging phone with just a little flash and the alias   delivered  every single key is actually an e ink display so when the phone is flipped open clamshell style they're ordered and labelled for use primarily as a phone but when you flip it open sideways they're oriented properly and filled primarily with letters and other keys for messaging  other reviews are right when they say it'll take you a little bit of time to get used to the phone  although the key labels change  the layout does not  so sometimes a key seems like it would be more convenient in a slightly different place  the truth is  it would be  but that's the only place to put it when the phone is opened in that orientation  you'll occasionally find minor frustration with the fact that if you read a text with the phone opened clamshell style that it'll close the message and make you re open it when you shut it and open the door sideways to respond more easily  these really are minor issues  however  that did not diminish my enjoyment of this phone  clearly a lot of thought and effort was put into this redesign of the alias  and though you might worry about the strength and durability of the hinge  i had no problems with our two despite heavy use and having purchased them used with visible wear other reviewers are dead on about the fact that you very much want to buy the extended battery and door  while it makes the phones slightly more bulky  it also allows you to talk and text extensively and still only need a charge about every     days http www amazon com samsung alias extended battery sch u    dp b   sl tsq ref pd sim cps   ie utf  refrid  bj    rf f a    w  \n",

            "i have owned several flip phones while on t mobile network and love their usability  low cost  pocketability  voice quality  and battery life  samsungs have served me well and i thought i might be stepping up from the samsung t     flip phone i had previously used on t mobile when ordering this phone to replace my motorola droid  smartphone  on verizon network first and most damning observation is that the signal strength on this phone is inferior to my droid  dropped calls in the house     bars on droid and     bars outside whereas droid delivers     bars  i cannot make a meaningful comparison against my other flip phones as they are on a different network  but if you are looking for good signal  this phone doesn't deliver second issue is that the interface tries to be  cute  with an office or apartment analogue  move your cursor to different parts of the room to access different features of the phone  the reason i was trying to replace the droid smartphone was to get away from these distractions and back to a sensible menu icon driven interface no luck here third  i was hoping to pair this phone to either my ipod touch or samsung galaxy player both bluetooth devices with no luck  that's all i have to say about that fourth  the phone is quite a bit bulkier than other flip phones i have used  not quite as bad as some of the  ruggedized  flip phones still being manufactured  but almost large enough to seem imposing when open and pressed against your face  so a strike against it for pocketability fifth  the keys  while interesting in their ability to be re purposed based upon orientation  don't match up well with the on screen prompts and their size makes dialing out a bit more tedious  there are no obvious green  answer  and red  hang up  buttons  which make it more frustrating when another call comes in while you're on the phone sixth  the audio feedback is not much more sophisticated than simple beeps and blips reminiscent of an old computer  combined with the blocky keys  the phone gives the impression of being a draft or concept design  rather than a finished commercial product a few other points worth mentioning  there is a power button on the side of the phone  which seems very likely to be triggered when shoved into a pocket  also  no wi fi access on a phone with a feature set that begs for it sadly flip phones are being driven to the brink of extinction and the alternative choices are increasingly limited  however much i might despise my  smartphone   i don't consider the alias   a viable replacement for the above reasons \n",
            "i love this phone  they work great and still take a beating  i wish they still made them like this instead of pushing  smart phones  onto everybody \n",
            "this phone is great  i have dropped it a lot and it keeps on working  it has everything i need and it has a qwerty keyboard for texting  the best thing about it is that i do not have to get a data plan to use this phone on my verizon plan \n",

            "this phone works but only barely  i realize that everyone gets a phone in different condition  it's usually a matter of luck  however  my phone randomly shuts off and people on the other end of the phone line can barely hear me i am getting a new phone since i contacted the seller  another huge plus is that as of now verizon does not require a data package for this phone they used to \n",

            "i purchased this phone from this seller for the reason of the high ratings for customer satisfaction  but i completely thing this place is awful  the shipping was under estimated and on top of that  the phone is faulty  it was under the lable  good condition  and is was said to have  minor scratches  but it does deserve that title when i opened the box of the phone  it of course had the minor scratches as promised  but one of the outlets cover like where you would charge the phone was broken  and on top of that  the back cover didn't close all the way which meant the battery falls out all the time that was just the outside of the phone  when using the phone for the first few days  i found out that it would freeze up  it was completely unusable  and the only way to be able to use the phone was to take the battery out and power it back up in a few minutes  after a few months i found out that the phone would completely shut off if i closed it the wrong way which is annoying when i finally realize that my phone is off after a few hours and people are trying to get ahold of me the charger that came with it which was also promised was extremely cheap and stopped working after a few weeks i am not an avid phone user  i rarely take my phone with me  so it stays home about       of the time  i rarely use my phone too  i am not rough on it  it stays on the table  so i think the condition it is in is unacceptable  i payed around    dollars for it and never ever would i have wasted my money on this i have no idea how this company has had achieved such positive feed back  i am not dissatisfied with the phone  but the company that has sold the phone  the phone has been glitchy ever since i got it \n",

            "i have no intentions on paying for a data plan and unless you need something that has to endure construction work  you can't go wrong with this phone  since every feature phone verizon tries to offer you is a piece of crap on purpose  i'll probably just keep buying this every few years  it's one of the few phones that flips open two ways which is a huge plus for anyone who texts and calls people often  i don't understand why every feature phone isn't just designed this way \n",
            "i owned an alias before switching to a smart phone and then back to a lg cosmos    hugest mistakes of my life  the alias   albeit not perfect  is proof that basic phones could be amazing and not just overpriced pieces of trash that you see in today's market  the phone is durable and the clam to side ways flip makes texting a breeze  battery does well on its own  but for the price of the extended you can get four days of juice for about   more  the texting can be a bit odd sometimes i do miss just being able to type and auto starting a reply   but it isn't enough to hinder the experience of this phone  it also shoots video and decent pictures which is rare for even modern basic phones truth is  even for     or if you can find a decent price quality used  it is every bit worth it if you don't want to go smart phone \n",
            "this is the phone i have owned for about   years prior to purchasing this one  i really like this style and would highly recommend it especially for the older generation  it is easy to use  it does not come with all the bells and whistles of the more expensive phones  but i needed a replacement phone as my first one finally was giving out \n",

            "i cant rate the phone its self because i am returning it  it turns out that verizon requires a    a month data plan for using the phone  you would think that they would not make you pay for a data plan on a non smart phone that was bought third party \n",
            "i had the samsung zeal but it swam away  i am not interested in the new smart phones as i do not need all the bells and whistles  plus paying the additional costs associated with the smartphone just was not appealing  i searched in amazon and found the alias phone  i am sooooo glad i did  i love this phone i even like it better than my zeal  not having to renew my contract was just an added bonus  i like this phone so well i ordered a second one for my husband while it was still available \n",
            "i got the samsung alias    shipping was great  the only problem with the phone is that when i open it it has a blue or red tint to it and doesn't change even for pictures  it's the strangest thing \n",
            "this is the third time i have bought this phone and it is the best phone i have ever had  i had one about three or four years ago and loved it  that phone went through hell and still worked for three years  it finally snapped in half after falling from about      ft in the air  still works though  it's held together by one wire but still completely usable  i have had three or four phones in the year since that one broke  my boyfriend is terrible with phones but he bought one of these about a year and a half ago and still has it and it still works perfect  i just bought a new motorola rival have used it for two weeks and it's aweful so i just bought a new one of these \n",
            "there are a lot of things to like about this phone  the two way hinge is genius although i am worried that it may fail after repeated use  i also love the adaptable keyboard which automatically changes from dialpad to text mode depending on which way the phone is opened  theres also a keyboard select button that allows you to switch manually  wi fi would have made this phone damn near perfect  there are a few things i must complain about  there doesn't seem to be a windows interface  it's not mentioned in the manual or on the website  windows   recognizes the device when connected but then fails to find drivers or software for it  adding files to the phone requires removal of the memory card and attachment to the pc thru a card reader  the interface between the phone and the memory card could also use a bit of work  ringtones seem to only work when downloaded through verizon  the device seems incapable of simply accessing them from the card directory  i've also had problems getting bluetooth to function with other devices  for instance  with my garmin gps i can place calls but once connected i can't transmit voice or keypad entries  it's a shame samsung decided to scrap this model and pursue i phone replicas  with a little tweaking this could have been the perfect phone \n",
            "phone is a  fill in  until daughter's upgrade in october  she's happy with it phone was just as described and came quickly \n",
            "this cell phone was a duplicate replacement for the one my daughter accidentally damaged the seller under rated the product  i was pleasantly surprised to find the phone in near perfect condition  i believe the seller rated it a   out of      it was more like a     out of      my own phone  which is the same model  wasn't in as good shape as this one  everything works well with it  it came with a home and car charger i was also happy the phone was received within   days  much quicker than the time frame stated  my daughter had been without for     weeks  so this was very nice overall a great value for the money thank you cellular direct \n",
            "i missed this phone and verizon does not sell it anymore or anything close  i was able to get a  free  phone from verizon but that  free  phone cost more than this phone and not what i wanted  i got it fast and it worked as if it was new maybe it was forgot i love it \n",
            "note the newer models of this phone make it considered as a smart phone  so verizon will try to charge you more for most plans  i had found this out when i recommended it to someone i knew and they told me verizon wanted to charge    a month for a pre paid plan i have had this phone for a couple of years and it has held up pretty well  the charger did not though  and broke after about a year of light use  it was very cheap  so i ended up getting home wall ac dc travel house battery charger for verizon samsung alias   u    convoy sch u    flipshot u    cell phone bestcellbuy brand  which has worked just as well and shows no signs of falling apart pros sturdy phone i have not dropped it as much as the average person  but it barely has a scratch anyways capabilities of most phones  such as video  music  games  and the internet ability to use the phone as a normal flip phone flipping upwards or as a texting phone flipping on the side keypad works well to make texting much faster camera works as expected not too good  but not that bad battery life is pretty decent it lasts a few days if you use it a bit  and about a week if you do not use it muchcons works sluggish when you have too much information stored such as having a lot of text messages stored keypad has three separate screens  requiring a button to be pressed to switch to a different keyset in a certain order switching from letters to numbers  then numbers to symbols  then symbols to numbers  and then back to letters   mp  buttons on the front can be pressed when the phone in your pocket  this has resulted sometimes in my phone getting very hot because it is constantly on from these button presses  you have to use the  lock  button on the right side to prevent this from happening will constantly try to search for service if it is not in a service area  which wastes the battery very quickly if you go to sleep with it on and it does this  it will drain almost all of a full battery annoying low battery life sound that cannot be muted battery tends to get loose sometimes  the phone could be on but will turn off once you close it because the battery might be loose the phone will sometimes get confused as to what side you flipped it on  so you could flip your phone to the side and it will think you flipped it upwards keypad gets hot pretty quickly if you are using it constantlyeven though there are a large amount of problems with the phone  it works pretty well once you know how it works  there might be a better phone that is similar  and with verizon considering this a smart phone  you have a better chance of finding something better than this \n",
            "the phone has very small buttons and was shutting down on me when i first got it  this turned out to be caused by the battery not fitting in the phone tight enough and i had to tape the battery in  this made for a better contact and the phone remained on  i would not recommend this phone to anyone \n",

            "buttons all look the same  find myself having to really think and figure out how to navigate through the phones basic functions  have had it for a few months now  its the newer version of my older phone first alias   you also get hit with having to pay an additional      a month even if you don't want data internet capability  it is not exactly fast either when manipulating throughout the functions  get the zeal even though it cost more  there's more than a few reasons why it came out just a few months after he alias   \n",

            "i bought my samsung alias   in october      when my previous phone stopped working  i chose it because   it's a samsung  the brand with which i have consistently had the best luck and fewest problems    it is a  flip phone  design  which i prefer because the screen and keyboard are protected when not in use usually in my purse or pocket and i don't have to worry about  pocket dialing  someone unintentionally  and   i prefer an actual keyboard rather than a touch screen keyboard  the reasons i love this phone are all of the above plus  i rarely lose a call unless i am in an area that seems to be a notorious  dead zone  for everyone  the camera takes fantastic pictures  the available gps application is so cheap and easy to use  i can access my online email  i keep several  must have  games including scrabble and sudoku on shortcuts for quickest access  mp  capabilities  and of course  great texting the list goes on  i don't particularly want or need a smart phone and i think that's because i've been so incredibly happy with this phone  i am on amazon right now  looking for another one  because something seems to have gotten into the slot for the charger so i can't insert it to charge  i am heartbroken o i am way past due for an upgrade with my carrier and could probably get a much more sophisticated phone with my upgrade  but i'm just not ready to part with my alias   besides  i have never had trouble finding accessories for my alias   on amazon near impossible through my carrier  who only seems to stock parts and accessories for the newer  fancier phones they would rather you buy   bottom line love love love my samsung alias   additional note  added         i almost forgot one of the very best things about the samsung alias    no  auto correct   when i get texts from some of my friends and relatives who have phones that are a little newer fancier models  and the  auto correct  has done anything but  correct  their text content  i just crack up  i'll never forget the time my sister texted me that she was going to  club  my mother lol i don't even remember what she later told me she'd meant to type  i  locked  that text in my inbox and look at it whenever i need a laugh  who decided to call those  smart phones  anyway \n",
            "the customer service people were quick and responsive but that doesn't change that i was sent a phone with a battery that didn't fit so i bought a new one  only to discover that the charger also did not fit  it's a bit of a hassle when you're trying to get a new phone because your old one broke spending all this time and energy on buying and returning things  i don't want to go on a tirade about the purchase because  like i said  the cs was great and all  just annoyed about the purchase  i don't generally buy things based on how good the people are when i need to return them  so  there's that \n",
            "after contacting the seller about the issues i had about my order  he promptly addressed my needs  and sent out a suitable replacement  after further consideration  this is an excellent seller to buy from  they will do whatever it takes to care for the customer and their needs  any phone you buy has a small chance it could be a lemon  but this seller will go above and beyond to give you a great product and good service  ignore any bad reviews  because the chances are that they  like me  commented before the seller even had a chance to correct the issue  so dont stress  just buy \n",
            "the samsung alias   was a good phone  i actually really liked it however it did have a slight issue with durability  i have had   alias   phones  the first one was a random incident which i won't fault the design for  the second phone seemed to develop a problem where it would shut down when being opened or closed  which isn't good for some one who's job requires being on call    hours a day  the third phone is actually the reason i  upgraded  as i went to a casio commando so that my fiance could have my alias   due to having broke her phone's external display  with her  the alias   lasted about   months we both liked the phone because of the texting mode  where the phone opens sideways and offers a full qwerty keyboard  and opens like a regular flip phone and feels like a regular phone for calls  i'm not sure if it's a factory or service company choice or not  but it was nice that the ring tones for calls and texts were different to know which way the phone needed to be opened as far as the durability issues  when exposed to tap water  the phone is useless  when exposed to deionized water  like most electronic devices it is of course fine  a past issue i have had with other phones was impact resistance  the alias   seems to be less susceptible to impact or pressure damage  however if a llama steps on it  it's done not kidding about that one either  that's what happened to my fiance's hand down phone   one of the unique tests of a phones i suppose was radiation testing  one of the other employees at the reactor i worked at also had an alias   phone  and decided to upgrade to an i phone  and he decided to put the phone in a high gamma and neutron exposure area we put the phone in the reactor   and although sound quality suffered a little bit  it still worked  we ran the test for a student project  so we gathered some interesting data  but basically the phone can take        times the radiation that a human could and survive before the sound quality isn't good enough to interpret  we tested a few other phones as well as part of the project all samsung and the alias   actually did best unfortunately  samsung no longer makes the alias   phone  i would be leery of buying a used one due to the wear issues with the double open design  i  upgraded  to a casio brigade also no longer made  \n",

            "this is a great phone if you are not into the smart phones  personally  i have access to the internet  email  rss  etc all day long so i have no need of a full blown smart phone yet  i do communicate regularly via text msg  the big issues with my needs are that i absolutely hate phones with keyboards on the outside the lockouts are a pain and they inevitably find a way to unlock themselves and start dialing no matter what i do  i don't want a large display screen to gather all my finger and facial goo oh  you have it too  dont fool yourself and are too susceptible to breakage with my lifestyle not to mention they take up too much pocket real estate  and i don't want to buy a data package which is optional for this phone verizon   this phone's dual flip feature is excellent and allows me to use it conventionally or to open it and have a nice  qwerty keyboard running lengthwise  the e ink keys switch and flip accordingly so they are always upright  the one complaint i have is that there is no hot key for the camera when opened lengthwise but i did assign a hot key to access that menu it just takes a few more button strokes to activate the camera function  you do have to be careful of it when opening one handed  or letting young children play with it  the dual hinge is the weak link and i can see how it will break with uncontrolled pressure being applied incorrectly  i plan to keep my eye open for deals on these phones so i have a backup  if when this one breaks or is lost  a friend has had this same phone since they first came out and it is still going strong and in good shape  proof that it is not as volatile as some reviews might lead you to think  the downside to this review is that it might encourage others to buy them on the refurb market as i have done  thus depleting the supply or driving up its cost \n",
            "i hate the  candy bar  touch screen phones  i'm a multitasker so always trying to fix dinner while on the phone or fold laundry i need the ability to hold the phone between my cheeck and shoulder  this lets me do just that and i love the dual hinge design  i have a keyboard for texting and a phone i can hold as weird as i want battery life is pretty good and my only complaint is it does randomly turn itself off if you don't everyday or every other day to do updates also verizon really wants you to have a data package with this phone  but there is a way to turn it off bug the reps online or on the phone enough and they will do it \n",
            "my first phone and i was thrilled with it it had an accident and could not be fixed verizon no longer offered it but amazon did  i snatched it up in a heartbeat  i did not want a touch phone and this is a jewel  would order again if i ever need to \n",
            "great  the phone will actually fit into my pocket  buttons are large for messaging  handy to have the slide or open flip option  easy to adjust settings  i would recommend it to those who do not have a need for a data package  holds up well  i've already dropped it in the dugout a few times without damage \n",
            "bought this phone for my wife  who is not a techie  she uses a phone for phone calls and texting  the call quality is great  and she absolutely loves the swiveling keyboard so she can text with a full qwerty keyboard she used to pocket dial her touchscreen so we wanted a flip phone with a keyboard  and boy are they hard to find  wish they made more phones like this \n",
            "i am holding out on gettng a smart phone for as long as i can  i have used this alias phone for over   years without difficutlies  i had to buy a replacement because after   years and two times dropping the phone into water  the keyboard became un readable  it still worked but i was typing by brail  basically i would highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to have to upgrade to a smart phone  the alias   has a great big keyboard  which makes texting a breeze and a really decent camera for the size and techology at the time it came out the feature i like the most  is that it rotates between landscape and portriat mode  so that if you are active  like i am and want to put it in a pocket  or on your bike  etc   you can have it secure with the cover closed  and not be in jeopardy of 'butt' dialing someone  unintentially i highly recommend it \n",

            "i wanted a messaging phone with just a little flash and the alias   delivered  every single key is actually an e ink display so when the phone is flipped open clamshell style they're ordered and labelled for use primarily as a phone but when you flip it open sideways they're oriented properly and filled primarily with letters and other keys for messaging  other reviews are right when they say it'll take you a little bit of time to get used to the phone  although the key labels change  the layout does not  so sometimes a key seems like it would be more convenient in a slightly different place  the truth is  it would be  but that's the only place to put it when the phone is opened in that orientation  you'll occasionally find minor frustration with the fact that if you read a text with the phone opened clamshell style that it'll close the message and make you re open it when you shut it and open the door sideways to respond more easily  these really are minor issues  however  that did not diminish my enjoyment of this phone  clearly a lot of thought and effort was put into this redesign of the alias  and though you might worry about the strength and durability of the hinge  i had no problems with our two despite heavy use and having purchased them used with visible wear other reviewers are dead on about the fact that you very much want to buy the extended battery and door  while it makes the phones slightly more bulky  it also allows you to talk and text extensively and still only need a charge about every     days http www amazon com samsung alias extended battery sch u    dp b   sl tsq ref pd sim cps   ie utf  refrid  bj    rf f a    w  \n",

            "i have owned several flip phones while on t mobile network and love their usability  low cost  pocketability  voice quality  and battery life  samsungs have served me well and i thought i might be stepping up from the samsung t     flip phone i had previously used on t mobile when ordering this phone to replace my motorola droid  smartphone  on verizon network first and most damning observation is that the signal strength on this phone is inferior to my droid  dropped calls in the house     bars on droid and     bars outside whereas droid delivers     bars  i cannot make a meaningful comparison against my other flip phones as they are on a different network  but if you are looking for good signal  this phone doesn't deliver second issue is that the interface tries to be  cute  with an office or apartment analogue  move your cursor to different parts of the room to access different features of the phone  the reason i was trying to replace the droid smartphone was to get away from these distractions and back to a sensible menu icon driven interface no luck here third  i was hoping to pair this phone to either my ipod touch or samsung galaxy player both bluetooth devices with no luck  that's all i have to say about that fourth  the phone is quite a bit bulkier than other flip phones i have used  not quite as bad as some of the  ruggedized  flip phones still being manufactured  but almost large enough to seem imposing when open and pressed against your face  so a strike against it for pocketability fifth  the keys  while interesting in their ability to be re purposed based upon orientation  don't match up well with the on screen prompts and their size makes dialing out a bit more tedious  there are no obvious green  answer  and red  hang up  buttons  which make it more frustrating when another call comes in while you're on the phone sixth  the audio feedback is not much more sophisticated than simple beeps and blips reminiscent of an old computer  combined with the blocky keys  the phone gives the impression of being a draft or concept design  rather than a finished commercial product a few other points worth mentioning  there is a power button on the side of the phone  which seems very likely to be triggered when shoved into a pocket  also  no wi fi access on a phone with a feature set that begs for it sadly flip phones are being driven to the brink of extinction and the alternative choices are increasingly limited  however much i might despise my  smartphone   i don't consider the alias   a viable replacement for the above reasons \n",

            "this phone started out working beautifully for the last few weeks  although the punctuation for texting is very inconvenient and lacking   if you get a properly working phone  it seems pretty solid  the camera has bad resolution  so if you are set on a good camera  this is not for you  overall it has good audio and is solidly built not sure if the malfunctioning is typical or not  last night it started acting crazy  when the phone is shut  it keeps activating the  voice command  function  and shows a microphone icon indicating that it is listening for my voice prompt  then if there is noise  it sometimes starts randomly calling people based on what it maybe thinks it's hearing  i also think that this prevents it from going into standby mode  therefore it is wasting my battery power  i looked into various settings menus  but it seems there is no way to shut this function off  secondly  it has recently started pulling up a  no caller id available   alert message in front of every text message i get  even though i can see the person's name attached message before i try to open it  furthermore  when i try to hit  ok  to acknowledge the alert  it pops right back up  over and over again  so i can't read my texts  it does this even for old texts  i tried turning it off and taking the battery out  i even tried a factory reset function  and i'm still having the same problems  i also noticed that after i reset it  when it was going through the set up  that the basic ringtones weren't playing at all  even when they said they were  i could hear nothing and i can't hear a dial tone when i call people  screwed up hopefully it's not a common issue for this phone  it would've been good until this started \n",
